# Nested Worktree Protocol

Agent work uses registered nested slots. A normal slot has all three product
worktrees, each with its own writable build output:

```text
worktrees/<slot>/hermit
worktrees/<slot>/reverie
worktrees/<slot>/liteinst2
```

Never develop in the primary `hermit/`, `reverie/`, or `liteinst2/` checkout,
and never create an agent worktree with raw `git worktree add`. Read
`AGENTS.md` and
`ai_docs/transient/2026-07-27-worktree-management-map.md` before changing slot
state.

## Allocate a slot

Use the registry-aware allocator from the repository root:

```bash
scripts/allocate-worktree.rs \
  --agent hermit-api \
  --task impl-example \
  --product all \
  --purpose "Implement the example change"
```

The allocator chooses a canonical available slot, creates the nested product
worktrees from their primary checkouts, and atomically updates both
`worktree-state.json` and the managed table in `worktrees/ACTIVE.md`. Those
files are machine-local; do not hand-edit their managed state. At most twelve
slots may be active and at most five clean slots may be parked. If allocation
reports an ownership conflict or capacity problem, preserve the existing slot
and escalate rather than deleting it.

`scripts/slot-init.sh <slot> [product] [start-point]` is an unregistered manual
scaffolding fallback. It creates detached worktrees but does not update either
registry, so it is not the normal path for live agent work.

## Work in the slot

Confirm every assigned checkout is clean before editing. Fetch the intended
remote base without changing checked-out files, then create a task-specific
feature branch inside each product repository that will change. Leave
unchanged products detached and record their exact SHAs. Product source,
formatting, builds, tests, and commits all run inside the assigned nested
checkout; parent-only coordination changes remain in the parent repository
under explicit ownership.

Never share a writable path or branch. Research-only sharing and mutating
agents with disjoint path ownership must be explicitly recorded by the
allocator and in `worktrees/ACTIVE.md`.

## Close and release

Before release, record each product's branch, exact SHA, validation, and
publication disposition in `worktrees/ARCHIVED.md`. All assigned checkouts must
be clean. Remove a completed slot through the registry-aware release script:

```bash
scripts/release-worktree.rs --slot <slot> --clean
```

Omit `--clean` only when deliberately retaining a clean parked cache. The
release script updates both machine-local registries and never deletes feature
branches. Never release, remove, reset, clean, or reuse a slot containing work
that has not been handed off with a recovery SHA.
