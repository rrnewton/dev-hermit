"""Regenerate experiments/INDEX.md from what is ON DISK.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A measurement that cannot be found costs exactly as much as one never taken —
and more, because the second measurement may disagree with the first and nobody
will know to reconcile them. This index is DERIVED, never hand-filed: run it and
the index reflects reality. Nobody has to remember to update a database.

WHAT IT MINES, per experiment directory:
  date      the _YYYYMMDD slug suffix, else the directory mtime
  what      metadata.json "question", else the README's first heading
  headline  the first result-bearing line under a Verdict/Result/Finding heading
  how       provenance markers found in the text (observed / measured / recorded
            / sampled / computed / estimated / modelled) — the distinction that
            went unrecorded when 21.8x and 2.2x turned out to be the same
            quantity measured two ways
  who       metadata.json agent/author, else the directory's first git author
  where     the path

Rows are pipe-delimited so `grep` finds them and `awk -F'|'` parses them.

HEADER = """# Index of measurements taken

**A measurement that cannot be found costs exactly as much as one never taken** — and more,
because a second measurement may disagree with the first and nobody will know to reconcile
them.

This file is **DERIVED, not hand-filed**. Regenerate it:

```
python3 experiments/build-index.py          # rewrite
python3 experiments/build-index.py --check  # exit 1 if stale
```

**Find a measurement:** `grep -i <term> experiments/INDEX.md`, or
`awk -F'|' '$5 ~ /observed/' experiments/INDEX.md` to filter by provenance.

**`how` is the load-bearing column.** `21.8x` and `2.2x` were once the same quantity
measured two ways — one computed, one observed — and the disagreement went unnoticed for
hours because neither was recorded with its method. `unstated` means the artifact does not
say; treat such a number as unqualified until you check the source.

**Adding a measurement:** write it into `experiments/<name>_YYYYMMDD/` with a `README.md`
(a `## Verdict` or `## Result` heading, and put the number in the first line under it) and
a `metadata.json` carrying at least `question` and `agent`. Then regenerate. Do not edit
the table by hand — it will be overwritten.

## Other places measurements live (this index covers `experiments/` ONLY)

Search these too before re-deriving a number — an index that silently omits half the
corpus reproduces the problem it solves:

| surface | what is there | how to search |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_docs/*.md` | analysis artifacts; many carry measured tables (per-node CPU/wall, ledger stats, corpus counts) | `grep -ril <term> ai_docs/` |
| `ignored/validate-run-ledger.jsonl` | every local validate run: wall, CPU, result, counts | `ci-hub ledger qualified-rows`, never a raw `grep`+`tail` |
| ci-hub history store | per-DAG-node CPU/wall distributions | `python3 ci-hub/history/query.py node-cpu-budgets` |
| task notes | measurements posted but never filed to disk — **the lossy surface** | `tg` search |

## Known-LOST measurements

Recorded here so a future searcher gets a hit instead of silence, and so nobody
"remembers" a number and cites it as measured.

| what | value quoted | when | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| per-process `cc1plus` peak RSS | ~522 MiB | 2026-08-04 | **UNRECOVERABLE.** Quoted in three dispatches, never written to a task or artifact. Verified 2026-08-05: no artifact under `experiments/` or `ai_docs/` contains it (all `522` hits are unrelated — dpkg file lists and regex benchmarks at 522 MB/s). **Do not cite it as measured. Re-measure and file it.** |
