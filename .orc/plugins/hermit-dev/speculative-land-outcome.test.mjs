// Durable regression test for the speculative-land tick's OUTCOME CLASSIFICATION
// and its ALERT-DEDUPE INVARIANT.
//
// Why this file exists as a standalone harness rather than an import: the logic
// under test lives inside a `wf.loop` closure in index.ts, which cannot be
// imported without an `orc` host. Rather than restructure production code to be
// testable (scope this task does not have), the decision table is transcribed
// here and pinned. That transcription is the test's known weakness, so it is
// guarded: `test_transcription_matches_index_ts` greps the real file for each
// expression below and fails if index.ts drifts from what is pinned here.
//
// Run: node .orc/plugins/hermit-dev/speculative-land-outcome.test.mjs
// Exits 0 on pass, 1 on failure, and prints counts on both sides.

// === 1. The steady state must stay silent ====================================
// Live ticks return exit 1 with gate semantics ("checked=5 unresolved=5
// remediation_required=0"). Exit 1 is NOT a failure here. If this ever classifies
// as error/pollFailed, the fleet gets an alert every 15 seconds.

}

// === 3. Exit 3 must not collide with remediation's exit 2 ====================

// remediation-required it would send a wake to hermit-lander for a fault that
// never happened.

// === 4. THE DEDUPE INVARIANT (the defect this test exists to prevent) ========
// The alert signature must NOT contain elapsed_ms. If it did, every repeated
// timeout would produce a fresh signature, defeat the kvGet/kvSet dedupe, and
// turn one repeating fault into an alert storm at the 15s tick interval.

    "REGRESSION GUARD: folding timing into the signature would break dedupe",
    poisoned === false,

// Without this, index.ts could change and every assertion above would keep
// passing against a stale copy -- a test that verifies nothing.
