"""Verdict producer for the strict-standard components — detlog, stack, heap.

OWNERSHIP: this module renders VERDICTS. It does not run guests, does not
capture output, and must never grow a collector. hermit-w7 owns collection (42
cells, 1260 runs at n=30, planted-divergence control) and calls in here with
already-captured text. Rewriting that collector would discard real measurement;
duplicating it here would create the two-implementations problem this split
exists to avoid.

WHAT A COLLECTOR PASSES IN: the raw combined stdout+stderr of a run, exactly as
captured. This module finds its own records. Callers do not pre-filter, because
a caller that filters is a second extractor that can silently disagree with this
one about what a record is.

=== THE THREE DECISIONS THAT MAKE THIS NON-VACUOUS ===

1. EMPTY IS NOT AGREEMENT, and for stack/heap this is the whole ballgame.
   `detlog_stack` and `detlog_heap` DEFAULT TO FALSE (hermit metadata.rs:213-214;
   the emitter is gated at detcore/src/lib.rs:719). A run without those flags
   emits ZERO stack records, two empty streams have an identical digest, and a
   bare `a == b` reports PASS. That single line would make the entire stack and
   heap dimension green by default, forever, on runs that measured nothing. Zero
   records is NOT_MEASURED — a third state, never a pass and never a failure.

2. STACK AND HEAP YIELD TWO VERDICTS EACH, NOT ONE. A memory record is
   `<addr-range> <perms> ... [stack|heap] -> <sha256>`, carrying an ADDRESS claim
   and a CONTENT claim in one line. These are measured to disagree: contents
   match across runs while addresses do not. Comparing the whole line collapses
   them, and the collapsed answer is dominated by the address half — so a
   content-deterministic backend scores FAIL for a layout reason. Reported
   separately, each with its own denominator.

3. SELF-DETERMINISM IS THE DEFAULT AXIS. Cross-backend equality is refused for
   detlog because the backends emit different record counts for the same guest
   (measured 141 / 368 / 1245): equality is false by construction and a single
   parity percentage has no denominator. See `cross_backend_prefix`.
