# built, so every cell resolves through the absence taxonomy rather than
# executing anything. That is exactly the property under test — the collector
# must emit a TYPED row for every known backend even when nothing can run.
#
# Bracketed on both sides per the Proxy Binding axis: each assertion below has a
# positive case (the expected token IS emitted, with a nonzero count) and, where
# it is meaningful, a negative case (the wrong token is NOT emitted).
