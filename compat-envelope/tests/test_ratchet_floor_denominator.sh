# A ratchet floor is meaningless against a population it was not measured over.
#
# The floors in collect-fullcorpus.sh were measured over a 235-cell corpus. 30 of
# those cells (`performance/*`) became unbuildable when their sources stopped
# existing in Hermit, leaving 205. The gate went on comparing 205-cell results
# against 235-cell floors and reported FOUR "REGRESSION" lines that were pure
# denominator error — two of them (ptrace 214, e9patch 214) numerically
# unreachable no matter how green the run was. A gate whose only possible output
# is a false red is worse than no gate: it trains readers to ignore it.
#
# The fix carries the denominator WITH the floor and refuses instead of lying.
# This test brackets all four outcomes, because the easy mistake is to silence
# the false red by making the gate incapable of ever firing.
#
# Usage: test_ratchet_floor_denominator.sh [collect-fullcorpus.sh]
