# The declaration must bite in BOTH directions, or it is decoration.
#
# A column blank on every published row has no producer. That state is invisible
# to every landed guard -- the schema guard sees the column in the header and is
# satisfied; check_cell_comparison.py iterates verdicts, finds none, and reports
# `0 of 0`, exit 0. It passes BECAUSE the producer is missing. It also cannot be
# mutation-tested: there is nothing to plant a wrong value in.
#
# So the schema declares which columns have no producer, and this pins that the
# declaration cannot rot in either direction:
#   * a value appearing in a declared-unimplemented column is REFUSED, so no cell
#     can quietly appear to satisfy a comparison nobody performs;
#   * a clean tree PASSES, so the guard is not refusing everything;
#   * removing a column from the declaration while it is still blank is allowed
#     ONLY together with a producer -- pinned here as: an undeclared blank column
#     is not refused, which is what makes deleting the declaration a deliberate
#     act rather than a silent one.
