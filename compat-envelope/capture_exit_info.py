"""Producers for the two absent comparisons: EXIT CODE and INFO LOG.

Of the seven named comparison fields, stdout is the only real producer,
`bitwise_parity` is a hardcoded blank, and five are absent. This supplies two of
those five. detlog/stack/heap are tracked separately.

MODELLED ON `capture_parity` (collect-envelope.rs:744), deliberately, because that
one demonstrably works: it computes SHA-256 digest equality against the ptrace
reference, and the shipped population contains **96 FALSE values in
scorecard.csv** (348 across all four scorecards) — proof it fires rather than
always passing. The two producers here keep its shape:

  * the REFERENCE is ptrace, run identically to the candidate;
  * the comparison is digest equality, not a hand-rolled predicate;
  * a side that cannot be observed yields **None** (unknown), never False —
    an unmeasured cell must not read as a confirmed mismatch.

WHY THESE TWO DID NOT EXIST. Both are discarded upstream rather than missing:

  * EXIT CODE — `run_and_hash` (collect-envelope.rs:1106) does
    `if !out.status.success() { return None }`. The exit status is right there
    and is thrown away, so a cell that exits 1 under one backend and 0 under
    another is indistinguishable from a cell that could not be measured.
  * INFO LOG — `run_and_hash` never passes `--log=info --log-file`, so no INFO
    log is produced to compare. INFO log is a NAMED COMPONENT of the strict
    standard (stdout + INFO log + stack + heap), so its absence is what makes a
    strict claim dishonest.

NORMALISATION, stated because a digest is only as honest as what it hashes. The
INFO log digest strips exactly one thing: the leading wall-clock timestamp,
which is genuinely irreproducible. Addresses are NOT normalised — an
allocation-order change is a real divergence and hiding it is the fake-green
move. This is the same rule the prefix-parity work uses, so the two agree.
