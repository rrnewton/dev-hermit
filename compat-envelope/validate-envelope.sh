# validate-envelope.sh — the compat-envelope REGRESSION gate.
#
# Runs the known-green cells for both the hermit Detcore envelope and the
# reverie B1.5 Guest/Tool boundary, asserts they stayed green, and (as a side
# effect) rewrites the scorecard CSVs recording exactly what was green this run.
#
# This is what the outer-repo `validate` entry point and CI call. It is
# deliberately fast + safe (regression mode only, no expansion sweep). The
# expansion sweep (full superset, bounded by safe-ci-dag-runner) is separate;
# see expansion-dag.rs.
#
# Exit non-zero if ANY enabled cell stopped passing (green-stays-green).
#
# Usage:
#   validate-envelope.sh [--lane LANE] [--repo HERMIT_CHECKOUT] [--no-reverie]
#                        [--backends b1,b2,...]

# of 2290 published rows while the candidate was populated in 2068 -- so no reader
# could tell parity-HELD from parity-DIFFERED from NEVER-ATTEMPTED. This keeps the

# record, which is strictly worse than the gap.

# asserting a parity its own operands cannot support, of which there are currently
