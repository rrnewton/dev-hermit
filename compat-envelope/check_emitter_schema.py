"""Refuse an EMITTER that would write a row shape its target file cannot hold.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE EMIT SIDE.
`check_cell_comparison.py` refuses a cell carrying a comparison verdict with no
reference. That closes the CHECK side: bad data already written is caught when
the checker runs. It does nothing to stop an emitter WRITING it. This closes the
emit side, and it also covers a class neither landed checker looks at:
ROW WIDTH vs HEADER WIDTH.

Schema skew is quiet in the worst way. An emitter that declares 36 columns and
appends into a 33-column file writes three fields past the last column. Nothing
errors. A reader lines the values up by index, so every column after the
divergence is read from the wrong place -- `ref_output_hash` comes back holding
whatever sits at that offset -- and the file still parses. The 19-vs-20 dbi
parity skew that redded hermit CI from a parent-only change was this same shape.

TWO REAL EXPOSURES MEASURED AT origin/main ON 2026-08-07, both caught below:
  * collect-envelope.rs declares 36 and defaults to scorecard.csv (33).
  * collect-reverie-compat.rs declares 34 and ALSO defaults to scorecard.csv.
    It is correct when its wrapper passes `--csv reverie-scorecard.csv` (34==34),
    which is why a by-hand audit pairing each emitter with "its" scorecard called
    it matching. The DEFAULT invocation is the exposure. Pair an emitter with the
    file it will actually open, not the one its name suggests.

DERIVED, NEVER HARDCODED. The pairs come from scanning the emitters, because a
hand-kept list of a growing set is the recurring defect this repository keeps
paying for -- and it is exactly how the second exposure above went unlisted.

AN EMITTER IT CANNOT PARSE IS A REFUSAL, NOT A SKIP. Dropping an emitter it
cannot understand would shrink the population silently and make the report look
best precisely where the tool understands least. Same rule as a dropped row
shrinking a denominator: unmeasurable is reported, never omitted.
