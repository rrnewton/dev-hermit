# Repo hygiene policy (parent dev-hermit) — experiments/ + debug/

Commit **code + reports + machine-readable state**. Never commit raw giant logs,
boot artifacts, dumps, VM/kernel images, or binaries.

## Default practice: ignored/-first

Write anything you know you won't commit — raw logs, boot artifacts, scratch, big
outputs — **directly into an `ignored/` dir from the start**. `ignored/` (and
`**/ignored/`) is gitignored, so there is **no commit-time judgment call**: junk
never enters the index. Only reports, the ledger/notebook, and machine-readable
state (`*.json`, `NOTEBOOK.md`, small curated `.log`/`.csv`/`.md`) live tracked in
`experiments/<foo>/` and `debug/<bar>/`.

## What is hard-ignored (clearly never commit)

VM/disk images (`*.qcow2 *.img *.raw *.iso`), kernels/initrd (`bzImage vmlinux
initramfs*.cpio* *.cpio`), boot/run dirs (`boots-*/ boot-*/ runs/`), archives
(`*.tar* *.tgz *.gz *.zip *.zst`), binaries (`*.bin *.a *.o *.so`), core dumps and
`*.perf.data`. `*.log` is deliberately **not** blanket-ignored — small curated
logs may be tracked; put big/raw logs under `ignored/`.

## The size backstop (`.githooks/pre-commit`)

A pre-commit hook WARNS and BLOCKS when a staged file exceeds a soft size limit
(default 1024 KiB; `HERMIT_HYGIENE_MAX_KB` to tune). It is only a safety net for
when the ignored/-first default is missed. Override when you have verified the
file is a genuinely-needed curated report/state:

```
HERMIT_HYGIENE_OVERRIDE=1 git commit ...
```

Install (per clone; `core.hooksPath` is local config, not tracked):

```
scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

## Per-directory tuning

Any `experiments/<foo>/` or `debug/<bar>/` may add its **own `.gitignore`** to tune
what lives-but-ignored locally (`dbg new-episode` scaffolds a starter one).

## VCS_MISSING.md (required per dir)

Every `experiments/<foo>/` and `debug/<bar>/` must carry a `VCS_MISSING.md`
describing what is NOT checked in (won't exist on a fresh clone): which artifacts
are missing, whether each is **regeneratable** (and how), and whether any tracked
code **depends on reading** it (which would fail on another machine). `dbg
new-episode` scaffolds it; `dbg vcs-check <episode>` lists the currently-ignored
paths so you can keep it current.

## Demo-touching commits (demos/**)

Separate hard gate: every runnable-demo change needs an adversarial green-demo
attestation before merge. See `demos/ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW-POLICY.md`, the CI job
`demo-review-gate`, and `.githooks/commit-msg` (checker: `scripts/check-demo-review.sh`).

## GitHub main health before push

`.githooks/pre-push` runs `ci-hub/bin/main-health` before every parent
push. It polls current-main `push` workflow runs for `rrnewton/dev-hermit`,
`rrnewton/hermit`, and `rrnewton/reverie` through `with-proxy gh`. A red main or
query failure emits a hard warning. The hook deliberately does not block because
the pending push may be the repair, but the coordinator must not claim green
until the live report is green.

## Parent main has exactly one writer

Every local `main` ref update and every push to `origin/main` must run through
`scripts/parent-main-write`. The helper holds the host-wide mutex across fetch,
compare, commit/ref update, push, and the fresh-fetch ancestry proof. It records
the fetched `origin/main` SHA as the compare-and-swap value; if either local
`HEAD` or the server-observed old value differs, publication is refused. A
normal non-force push remains the final remote CAS.

Ordinary parent changes use:

```bash
scripts/parent-main-write commit -m "message" -- path ...
```

Feature-checkout publication uses `scripts/parent-main-write publish [REV]`.
A direct clean-slot `git push ...:main` is refused: it is a writer too. Refresh
a behind local primary with `scripts/parent-main-write sync`; divergence is
reported for explicit reconciliation and is never reset.

Gitlinks and the enforcement hooks themselves use the retained audited path:

```bash
scripts/parent-main-write commit -m "message" \
  --audit-reason "why this repair is required" -- hermit .githooks/pre-commit
```

Audited commits retain mode, reason, and fetched-base trailers. Supplying a
reason after an unaudited sensitive commit was made does not bless it: publish
verifies the trailers in the commit. `--no-verify` cannot bypass the authority;
`reference-transaction` enforces the same lock/CAS receipt at the ref update.

## Primary checkout freshness before commit

`.githooks/pre-commit` runs `scripts/primary_checkout.py check` before every
parent commit. It warns when `hermit/`, `reverie/`, or `liteinst2/` is detached
or differs from the repository's live `origin/main`, when a parent gitlink is
stale, or when Hermit's tracked Cargo manifests do not pin the exact Reverie
main SHA. The warning is nonblocking so a gitlink or tooling repair can still be
committed. Run `make checkout-fresh` to fetch, check out `main`, and fast-forward
each clean primary, then commit and push the three gitlinks as one coherent
snapshot. Dirty primaries are preserved and skipped with a warning. Tick-hub
runs this same strict routine every five minutes; it hard-warns instead of
publishing if any cleanliness, branch, freshness, pin, or parent-main gate fails.

### The freshness invariant (`make check-primary-freshness`)

`check` above is advisory and product-scoped. The **invariant** is stated once,
in `primary_checkout.py`, and evaluated over **every primary including the
parent**:

> A primary is FRESH iff it is initialized, **not bare-flipped**, on `main` (not
> detached, not another branch), **exactly equal** to that branch on `origin`,
> and clean. A product checkout's commit differing from the parent gitlink is
> classified by that product's own check rather than treated as parent dirt;
> a staged gitlink update is still parent dirt and is never hidden.

Drift is reported by class — `bare`, `detached`, `wrong-branch`, `behind`,
`ahead`, `diverged`, `dirty`, `uninitialized`, `unknown` — naming *which* primary
and *how*, each with the exact command to fix it. Exit `0` fresh, `1` drift,
`2` at least one primary could not be evaluated (**nothing proven is not a
pass**).

Three properties are deliberate:

- **`behind`, `ahead` and `diverged` are separate classes.** "HEAD differs from
  origin/main" is not actionable; the three need different responses, and a
  relationship is only asserted when the remote commit is present locally to
  prove it. Otherwise the class is `unclassified-drift` and the tool says to
  fetch.
- **Nothing is reset, forced or fast-forwarded automatically.** A fast-forward
  moves the working tree of a shared integration surface with live sibling
  processes and ~126 dependent worktrees. `--restore-safe` repairs exactly one
  class, the accidental `core.bare` flip, because it rewrites a single config
  flag and touches no ref, index or file content.
- **Dirt is reported, never remedied.** The changes may be another agent's
  (Invariant 5), so the remediation is "attribute the changes first".

**Why the bare flip kept escaping.** Under `core.bare=true` the directory still
has `.git`, `branch --show-current` still answers and `rev-parse HEAD` still
answers, so a refs-only check sees a healthy primary while every work-tree
operation fails. The binding observation is
`git rev-parse --is-bare-repository`; note `git -c core.bare=false …` does **not**
override it.

**The reachable-accident root shape is documented, not yet normalized.**
`hermit/.git` is an in-tree repository directory hosting ~126 worktrees, with no
`.git/modules/hermit` — unlike `reverie`, `liteinst2` and `agent-utils`, which
use the standard gitfile + `.git/modules/<name>` layout and have never drifted.
Until that is normalized, the guard above is what re-asserts `core.bare=false`.

## The shared index: never `git commit` bare in the parent

Every agent in this parent shares one working tree and therefore **one
`.git/index`**. `git add` is not private. A bare `git commit` commits everything
currently staged, including paths another agent staged seconds earlier. This is
not hypothetical: six staged files were swept into commit `0b40af7` on
2026-08-06. Bare `git commit --amend` sweeps identically — which means the
landing `union-rebase.sh` scripts can absorb a bystander's work.

**The rule: stage and commit your explicit paths in ONE step.**

```bash
git add <your paths> && git commit -m "msg" -- <your paths>
```

`git commit -- <paths>` builds a temporary index from `HEAD` plus the named
paths, so the commit can only contain what you named, and everyone else's staged
work is left untouched. Verify afterwards with
`git log --oneline -1 -- <your paths>` that your commit owns them.

Three things worth knowing before you rely on it:

- **It only protects other people from you.** If someone else commits bare while
  your paths are staged, you are still swept. That is why the rule has to be
  universal, and why `.githooks/pre-commit` warns rather than relying on memory.
- **It commits the WORKING TREE, not what you staged.** If you staged one version
  and then edited the file, the edited version is what lands. Do not combine it
  with partial staging (`git add -p`).
- **A brand-new file must be `git add`ed first**; a pathspec commit alone refuses
  a path git has never seen.

Rejected alternative: a per-agent `GIT_INDEX_FILE`. It does give private staging,
but a commit from an index seeded by an earlier `read-tree HEAD` **silently
reverts** anything committed in the meantime — measured, it discarded a
concurrent change with no conflict and no warning. Strictly worse than the
problem it solves.

The `.githooks/pre-commit` shared-index guard **blocks bare commits by default**
(since 2026-08-06). Deliberate exception: `HERMIT_SHARED_INDEX_GUARD=warn` to
report and allow, `=off` to silence. It is independent of
`HERMIT_PIN_DRIFT_OVERRIDE`, which is a different guard.

The earlier warn-only default cited "12 call sites with no pathspec". **That
census was wrong twice**: it counted error-message strings as call sites, and its
grep missed the `--only` / `-o` plus separate-`--` argv form. Re-derived, every
tool site that commits in the *parent* working tree was already safe:

| site | form |
|---|---|
| `ci-hub/ci-hub.rs` ×2 | `git -C <root> commit -m MSG -o -- <path>` |
| `scripts/primary_checkout.py` | `git -C <root> commit --only -m MSG -- <paths>` |

The union-rebase amends are not parent commits at all — both scripts take
`WT=${1:?hermit worktree path}` and `cd "$WT"`, so they use that worktree's own
index and cannot race the parent. No call site needed converting; `-o -- <path>`
and `--only -- <paths>` were both verified ALLOWED under block before flipping.

Evidence and the planting harness (29 checks):
`experiments/shared-git-index-race_20260806/`.
