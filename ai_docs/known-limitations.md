# Known Limitations and Future Work

Status snapshot: 2026-07-21. This ledger distinguishes current `main` from
validated but unlanded feature branches. The prioritized dependency plan is in
[hermit-v2-roadmap.md](hermit-v2-roadmap.md).

## Platform and environment

- Production support is x86-64 Linux. Aarch64 is incomplete and macOS is not
  supported.
- Precise preemption needs accessible user-space PMU RCB counters. CPU model,
  perf policy, hypervisor behavior, and counter skid affect correctness and
  performance.
- CPUID faulting varies by host. RDRAND/RDSEED tests must distinguish feature
  exposure from interceptability.
- Hermit does not make a changing filesystem or external network peer
  deterministic. Pin or record all external inputs.
- Default CLI isolation needs nested namespaces and mounts. In the audited
  rootless container, host-network mode worked with relaxed seccomp and
  unmasked paths, while local-network `sysfs` required privileged execution.

Future work:

- land and document a reduced core-only/no-namespace mode;
- virtualize PID/TID and `/proc` semantics before claiming parity in that mode;
- add one capability preflight that reports namespaces, mounts, ptrace, PMU,
  CPUID, Yama, seccomp, and relevant host policy.

## CI and coverage

- The registered Hermit and Reverie self-hosted runners were offline at this
  snapshot, leaving trusted hardware jobs queued.
- A prior namespace probe passed, but full `cargo test -p hermit` still failed
  all six `hermit_modes` cases with mount `EPERM`. The probe did not cover the
  network namespace and nested `sysfs` path used by Hermit.
- Schedule-search CI fails on the current AMD runner because Reverie reports
  `AmdSpecLockMapShouldBeDisabled`, then panics in stack handling and times out.
- Cargo coverage is not equivalent to the historical Buck matrix. PMU,
  namespace, unlanded, ignored, and quarantined tests require separate counts
  at an exact SHA.
- The historical PMU wrapper can falsely skip all tests by matching obsolete
  `perf list` text.

Future work:

- run privileged or host-side self-hosted workers with dedicated state and a
  verified mount/network/sysfs capability matrix;
- land a portable RCB skid benchmark and calibrate per host/CPU;
- publish exact-SHA coverage ledgers and make every skip explicit;
- keep public external PRs off rootful self-hosted runners.

## Deterministic execution and performance

- Ptrace remains roughly 10x on syscall/thread microbenchmarks even with
  precise preemption disabled.
- Precise AMD PMU preemption caused roughly 40x CPU-only overhead in one
  benchmark because of about 1.9 million switches and a large skid margin.
- Serialized guest threads cannot reproduce genuine simultaneous weak-memory
  outcomes. Hermit is stronger for logical ordering, lifetime, locking, and
  filesystem invariants than for weak-memory litmus behavior.
- PID/TID identity, some metadata, memory mappings, descriptor flags, and many
  syscall modes remain partially modeled.
- Real-binary audits found process lifecycle, descriptor tracking, recorder
  ioctl, blocking network, and multiprocess replay/cleanup gaps.

Future work:

- separate PMU skid correction from backend cost and benchmark both;
- add per-syscall mode/flag support ledgers and differential tests;
- repair the minimized arbitrary-binary failure families before expanding
  workload claims.

## Record, replay, and debugging UX

- The recording engine and immediate verify path work for small examples, but
  the saved-recording `hermit replay` CLI had a Clap configuration panic in the
  audited build.
- `hermit run --verify-allow=failure` can report successful verification and
  still return the failing guest status. `hermit-verify
  --allow-nonzero-exit` is easier for automation.
- Trace/chaos replay can reproduce output/status but fail strict log checks on
  register-flag and alignment differences.
- Guest `/tmp` is isolated; summary paths there may disappear from the host.
  Artifact roots and retention are inconsistent across commands.

Future work:

- fix and test all replay CLI entry points;
- standardize automation exit status and structured output;
- define one host-visible artifact root, manifest, retention policy, and
  cleanup command;
- normalize or explain register-flag nondeterminism in strict verification.

## Schedule search

- Event-level search works on `hello_race` and `racewrite_nostdlib`, but replay
  jitter can violate the intended interpolation path.
- A one-swap result can still contain unmatched insert/delete events.
- Explicit schedule endpoints are unimplemented and automatic seed search is
  unbounded.
- Branch-level sub-event refinement is disabled and memory accesses are not
  directly observed.
- Search lacks repeated target-predicate stability sampling.

Future work:

- validate the realized schedule for every candidate and preserve verified
  opposite-outcome endpoints;
- implement stable event identity/alignment and bounded search;
- repair branch-count splitting and final A/B validation before enabling
  sub-event search;
- add memory/instruction instrumentation only as a separately scoped project.

See [schedule-search-guide.md](schedule-search-guide.md).

## QEMU and kernel testing

- A relaxed QEMU/TCG boot succeeds, but default deterministic and record modes
  are too slow or time out.
- RDTSC uses per-thread time while `clock_gettime` uses global time, causing
  guest TSC/device-clock skew. A global-time RDTSC prototype is unlanded.
- `ppoll`, futex absolute deadlines, vectored I/O, vhost-user ancillary data,
  inherited fds, PID/TID/rseq, and JIT mapping behavior need complete landed
  semantics and tests.
- virtme-ng adds host-kernel lookup, `CLONE_VFORK`, initrd-fd, helper, and live
  filesystem state. Vfork and syscall fixes are still draft PRs.
- KVM mode is dominated by stateful ioctls and shared memory effects; generic
  syscall recording cannot reproduce it.
- Hermit is not a replacement for syzkaller, KCSAN, KASAN, LOCKDEP, Razzer,
  Snowboard, or KRACE. It can add deterministic host-QEMU schedule artifacts
  after strict TCG run/verify works.

Future work:

- land coherent time, syscall, and vfork fixes with QEMU regression evidence;
- use pinned read-only VM inputs and remove or fully model live vhost-user
  state;
- reach repeatable TCG run/record/replay/verify before kernel race claims;
- start with known logical kernel concurrency bugs and guest-native oracles.

See [qemu-integration-status.md](qemu-integration-status.md).

## Alternative backends

- SaBRe is a separate synchronous x86-64 API. Basic restored workloads and a
  narrow speed probe work, but signals, lifecycle, state, generated code, PMU,
  CPUID/RDTSCP, and shared Reverie parity remain incomplete.
- The KVM backend is a protocol skeleton. The required gVisor Sentry bridge is
  unimplemented and would expose gVisor rather than host-kernel semantics.
- A fast syscall backend will not fix precise-PMU overhead.

Future work:

- finish bounded SaBRe runtime stabilization without changing shared core
  abstractions merely to claim parity;
- run a time-boxed DynamoRIO prototype against the same conformance suite;
- choose a fast-backend product boundary from workload and lifecycle evidence;
- defer the multi-month Sentry/KVM bridge until benchmarks justify it.

## Documentation maintenance

- Treat [pr-status.md](pr-status.md) as a dated snapshot and refresh live
  GitHub state.
- Mark every claim as landed, draft, local experiment, or proposal.
- Include exact repository SHAs, hardware/kernel/runtime state, commands,
  counts, and known skips in future handoffs.
