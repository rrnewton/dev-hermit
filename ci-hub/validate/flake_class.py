"""Distinguish a DEFECT red from a FLAKE / CONTENTION red in the validate ledger.

The asymmetry this addresses: a GAP in the ledger invites re-measurement, but a
recorded ``result: fail`` does NOT — nobody re-runs a commit the ledger condemns.
So a spurious red is *more* damaging than a missing record and is invisible
because it looks exactly like a real one. This module makes a red carry its
CONDITIONS so it can be interpreted rather than merely believed — the same
principle as the executed-count check (a verdict without its conditions is
uninterpretable), applied to failures instead of passes.

Two MEASURED false-red sources, both real:
  1. CONTENTION on the shared cargo package cache / build dir: #1592 FAILED at
     ``-j16`` (concurrent with other validates) and PASSED at ``-j4`` solo — and
     ``-j4`` was faster. The red was contention, not a defect.
  2. A measured FLAKY CELL: ``command_strict_verify`` was 9 PASS / 1 FAIL of 10
     under identical conditions. One run of it is a 90/10 coin; one tail lands a
     permanent red. See ``flaky-cells.json``.

This is the READ-SIDE half (parent tooling): it reclassifies already-recorded
reds so the false ones surface for re-measurement, and it works retroactively on
the whole ledger history. The WRITE-SIDE half — hermit/validate.sh recording the
``-j`` width and concurrent-validate count at run time, splitting the DAG gate
into manifest-check vs lane-run, and enforcing "re-run solo at -j4 before writing
FAILURE" — is a separate hermit PR. Until then this module DERIVES concurrency
from overlapping ledger intervals and PARSES the failing cell names from the run
log, so it is useful before the producer changes land.

Every classification carries its OWN firing conditions in ``reasons`` — the
classifier refuses to launder a guess into a verdict, just like the records it
judges.

    ``validate.sh`` and ``aggregate.py`` both name a partial run with a non-
    ``full`` profile, and ``aggregate.py`` additionally records an explicit
    ``full_coverage`` boolean. Prefer that explicit field when present; otherwise
    fall back to the profile taxonomy. This keys on the SAME ``profile == "full"``
    signal as the Rust ``validate_status::is_clean_full_coverage`` landing
    predicate.

    SCOPE OF THIS ANSWER, corrected 2026-08-07. This reports the run's DECLARED
    scope, not its achieved coverage, and the two are not the same. An earlier
    version of this docstring claimed "a partial pass can never be read as a full
    green here either"; that was false. The ``full_coverage`` field it prefers is
    emitted by NO current ledger writer (17 schema-3 rows and nothing since --
    schema 4 at ci-hub.rs:3849 and schema 5 at finalize_receipt.py:52 both omit
    it), so in practice this always falls through to ``profile == "full"``. On the
    live ledger there are 13 rows with ``profile == "full"`` whose own coverage
    block records fewer executed test nodes than planned -- e.g. ``aff18cf466e3``
    at 0/19 and ``ee3038998f`` at 4/19 -- and this function returns True for every
    one of them.

    That is acceptable HERE, because flake classification asks "was this run
    supposed to be full-scope?", which a declaration answers. It is not
    acceptable for a question about what actually ran. For that, use
    ``totality.classify``/``totality.is_total``, which decide from observed
    execution and return UNKNOWN rather than True when nothing records it. The
    two predicates disagree on 386 of 654 live rows -- by design, because they
    answer different questions. Do not swap one for the other without deciding
