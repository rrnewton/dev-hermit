"""Machine-wide validate-run visibility.

Sweeps and aggregates EVERY validate run on this machine into one view,
regardless of which repo (hermit or reverie), worktree, agent, or slot produced
it. Each record carries a `repo` discriminator so the two products are queryable
through one command and comparable over time. It unifies three data sources that
today live in disconnected places:

  1. Structured JSONL ledgers written by hermit/validate.sh and reverie/validate.sh
     (append_validation_ledger). hermit's default path is
     `$DEV_HERMIT_PARENT/ignored/validate-run-ledger.jsonl`, but a run whose
     DEV_HERMIT_PARENT is unset (most worktree / standalone runs) skips the
     append entirely, so the parent ledger only ever sees a fraction of runs.
     reverie instead writes to its own checkout-local `<root>/ignored/` (no
     DEV_HERMIT_PARENT dependence), which the per-worktree/primary globs below
     already discover, so a detached reverie run is recorded, not reconstructed.
  2. Raw per-run logs `$TMPDIR/{hermit,reverie}-validate.XXXXXX.log` (always
     written via mktemp, for EVERY run). These are the ground truth: this tool
     reconstructs a ledger-equivalent record for any log not covered by a JSONL
     ledger, recovering the otherwise-invisible worktree/standalone runs.
  3. safe-ci-dag-runner per-node profiling CSVs under
     `<checkout>/.safe-ci-dag-runner/profiles/` (aggregate + per-step). These
     are retained and appended across runs; this tool indexes them and links
     each run to its profiling by (checkout, git_sha, timestamp).

This is the "validate-run-ledger, extended to machine-wide" deliverable and
lives in the dev-hermit PARENT per the tracking-goes-outer principle.

Read-only by default. `--write-global` persists the unified view to
`<parent>/ignored/validate-run-global.jsonl` (a gitignored durable artifact).

Usage:
  ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py                 # table, newest last
  ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py --json          # unified records as JSON
  ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py --csv out.csv   # flat CSV
  ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py --write-global  # persist unified JSONL
  ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py --since 2026-08-03  # filter by date
  ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py --profiling     # profiling coverage view
