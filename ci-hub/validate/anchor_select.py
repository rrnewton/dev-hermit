"""ANCHOR-SELECT -- the one verifier for the GREEN-INHERITANCE ANCHOR authority.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS. An *incremental* (selective) validate run does not test the
whole suite; it tests only what the change can affect and INHERITS the rest of
its green from an earlier run. That earlier run is the ANCHOR. This tool decides
which commit may serve as the anchor for a given target, what diff drives the
selection, and whether the anchor still buys anything.

THE THREE RULES IT ENFORCES (owner directive, task
`green-inheritance-test-selection-anchored-on-full-main-validates`, 2026-08-04):

  1. ONE HOP ONLY. An incremental run anchors on a FULL green, NEVER on another
     incremental. Chaining COMPOUNDS the risk that the footprint map is wrong:
     each hop multiplies the chance that a test which should have run was
     skipped, and after N hops nothing in the chain was ever fully validated --
     the green becomes a claim about a claim. One hop bounds the error to a
     SINGLE selection decision against a known-full baseline.

     Enforced structurally: the anchor predicate requires
     `selection_mode == "full"`, and validate.sh stamps `selection_mode=selective`
     on every selective run (validate.sh `VALIDATION_SELECTION_MODE`). A
     selective receipt therefore can never be an anchor -- there is no second
     hop to take. `hop=1` is emitted in the record so the property is OBSERVED,
     not assumed. See `test_anchor_select.py::test_selective_receipt_refused`.

  2. THE ANCHOR PREDICATE IS THE SHARED QUALIFYING-RECEIPT PREDICATE, NOT
     `result == "pass"`. It is loaded from `qualifying-receipt.json` and NOT
     restated here. Keying on `result` alone anchors on the compat-only receipt
     population: measured on the live ledger (585 rows, 2026-08-05), 346 rows
     satisfy `result == "pass"`, of which only 107 qualify -- 239 (69%) would be
     accepted as anchors by a bare-`result` selector, including 164
     `portable-strict-compat-only` rows and 44 rows that are not commit-anchored.

  3. THE ANCHOR MUST BE AN ANCESTOR OF THE TARGET. `select-tests.rs` computes its
     LOCAL delta as `git diff --name-only <baseline>...HEAD` -- THREE dots. For a
     NON-ancestor baseline that silently relocates the effective anchor to
     `merge-base(baseline, HEAD)`, a commit that carries NO receipt at all: the
     run would inherit green from a commit nothing ever validated. Measured on
     the live ledger: of 105 distinct qualifying commits only 11 are ancestors of
     the current hermit HEAD; 86 are not. This tool requires ancestry and then
     uses TWO-dot `<anchor>..<target>`, so the property is load-bearing and
     visible instead of being papered over by merge-base.

WHAT THE DIFF DRIVES. Selection base is `TIP vs ANCHOR`, **not** `tip vs tip-1`.
Every change since the anchor is in scope, so the selected set grows -- and the
saving DECAYS -- as the tip drifts from the anchor.

WHEN TO REFRESH (DERIVED, never a picked commit count):

  * HARD, exact, available today: `selector decision == full` => the selected set
    IS the full set => the saving is exactly ZERO => RE-ANCHOR NOW. Because
    `force_full` is MONOTONIC over the union of the window, once ANY commit since
    the anchor touches a force_full-class path (`Cargo.*`, `ci/**`, `validate.sh`,
    `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.cargo/**`, gated workflows) the cumulative diff
    forces full at EVERY greater distance. The decay is therefore a CLIFF, not a
    smooth curve; this tool reports the FIRST force_full-class path in the window
    as `reanchor_cause` so the trigger names its own reason.

  * SOFT, correct, BLOCKED: `selected_wall / full_wall >= theta`. This is the
    signal that matches the cost model, and it is NOT available: no per-node wall
    durations are recorded anywhere (ci/test-selection.md "power-to-weight has no
    duration data yet"; the ledger records whole-run `real_seconds` only). The
    node/cell FRACTIONS reported below are an OPTIMISTIC proxy for it -- they
    weight every node equally while full-run wall is dominated by a few heavy e2e
    cells -- so they are REPORTED and never gated on. Unblocking this needs
    per-node duration emission in the receipt.

USAGE
  anchor_select.py --target <sha-or-ref> [--checkout <path>] [--ledger <path>]
                   [--selector <path/to/select-tests.rs>] [--include-dirty]
                   [--max-scan N] [--no-floor] [--json]

EXIT CODES
  0  INHERIT-SELECTIVE / INHERIT-CLEAN -- an anchor exists and selection saves.
  3  RE-ANCHOR-NOW -- an anchor exists but the selected set is the full set.
  4  NO-ANCHOR -- no qualifying full green ancestor; the target must run FULL.
  2  REFUSED -- bad input (unresolvable target, unreadable ledger/predicate).
  5  ERROR -- the selector or git failed; the caller must fall back to FULL.

Every non-zero exit means "run the full lane". There is no path on which a
failure of this tool produces a smaller test set.
