"""Gate COMPLETENESS for a ledger receipt: did all declared gates genuinely run?

THE BUG THIS FIXES.  `flake_class.gate_counts` substitutes a hardcoded
`FULL_GATES_EXPECTED = 5` whenever a schema-3+ full receipt does not declare
`gates_expected`.  `qualified_rows.is_qualified` then treats `ran >= expected`
as PROOF of completeness.  So a receipt that ran 5 gates of the current 6-gate
contract, and declared no contract of its own, resolves to `(5, 5)` and is
certified a complete green:

    plant: schema=5, profile=full, gates_run=5, gates_expected ABSENT
      gate_counts -> (5, 5)   is_qualified -> True     <-- a 5-of-6 partial, accepted
    same row with gates_expected=6 declared
      gate_counts -> (5, 6)   is_qualified -> False    <-- correctly refused

The defect is not the read order.  It is that **an INFERRED denominator cannot
prove completeness**.  `flake_class` says so itself: "the hardcoded
FULL_GATES_EXPECTED can lag the live plan (a full run today executes six gates
against a hardcoded expectation of five)".  Once the plan moves to six, the
hardcode silently reclassifies every 5-of-6 short run as complete, and nothing
reports it -- a green that never carried what it verified.

THE RULE.  A green must carry its own conditions.  A count-capable receipt
(schema >= DECLARE_REQUIRED_SCHEMA) must DECLARE `gates_expected`; an inferred
expectation is not evidence and cannot certify completeness.  Older receipts
predate the field and can never be improved, so they keep the legacy inference
-- explicitly labelled `inferred` rather than silently blessed.  This is a
RATCHET: it closes the hole for every receipt the current producer emits without
retroactively voiding history it cannot fix.

WHY NOT JUST BUMP THE CONSTANT TO 6.  That re-arms the same trap at the next
contract change and buys nothing: the receipt still would not carry its own
denominator.  It also breaks `flake_class.is_truncated`, which deliberately
treats an over-run (`ran > expected`) as a complete PASS precisely BECAUSE the
hardcode lags.  This module therefore does NOT touch `gate_counts`;
`is_truncated` keeps its own semantics.
