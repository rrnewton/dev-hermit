        in the build tree and is fixed by clearing state — different owner,
        different remedy, so they are not merged. See
        ``_host_env_signature_for`` for the two-tier scoping that keeps a product
        test's own "… not found" assertion output out of this class.
      * ``code`` — otherwise. A failing build/setup node with no infra or
        host-environment signature is a genuine compile error in the change under
        test (still ``code``); a failing test/e2e/lint/doc node is a product
        failure.
    ``known_flaky`` is advisory only (a failing test node whose name is in the
    measured-flake registry); it never downgrades ``fault_class`` — a flake is
    still a code-domain result to be re-run, not an infra fault.

    Both signature fields are always present so no evidence is discarded: a node
    carrying BOTH a corrupt archive and a missing host tool records both, and only
    the headline ``fault_class`` is forced to pick one.
