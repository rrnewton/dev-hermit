"""MUTATION SUITE FOR GUARDS — a score, not an anecdote.

Planting a violation IS mutation testing. Done ad hoc it yields one data point:
"we planted a violation and it was caught". Done as a suite it yields a
COVERAGE MEASUREMENT: `killed / total`, plus the individual survivors — and every
survivor is a guard reporting health while not guarding.

THE BRACKET IS THREE PARTS, NOT TWO
-----------------------------------
  1. the mutant IS KILLED (the guard refuses it);
  2. THE LEGITIMATE POPULATION SURVIVES, COUNTED -- a guard that kills
     everything passes (1) perfectly and is useless, so a mutant is only scored
     once its guard's population control has been counted;
  3. the mutant CLEANS UP -- nothing planted may outlive the run.

HARD PRECONDITION, LEARNED THE EXPENSIVE WAY
--------------------------------------------
THE MUTANT MUST NOT BE ABLE TO TRIGGER THE LIVE HAZARD. Planting a
`locally-validated` label on a cold PR can satisfy merge-gate and AUTO-MERGE:
planting an AUTHORISATION is unsafe; planting an INERT artifact is safe. That
rule is enforced here rather than remembered -- every mutant declares a
`hazard` class, and `Mutant.__post_init__` REFUSES to construct an
authorisation-capable mutant. A precondition you have to remember is one you
will eventually forget at 3am.

USAGE
  python3 ci-hub/validate/mutation_suite.py            # run, print the score
  python3 ci-hub/validate/mutation_suite.py --json     # machine-readable
  python3 ci-hub/validate/mutation_suite.py --guard qualified_rows
Exit 0 iff every mutant was killed AND every population control held AND every
registered mutant actually RAN. Exit 1 on a real failure (survivor, skipped
probe, or a broken population control); exit 2 when nothing failed but some
registered guard could not be exercised here -- a clean score over guards that
never ran is the vacuity this suite exists to detect, so it does not read as 0.

#
# The backend-parity C fixtures each carry their own negative bracket: compiling
# with -DHERMIT_TEST_ORACLE_NEGATIVE drops one satisfied check, so a working
# fixture exits 0 clean and 1 mutated. That is a real mutation and this is the
# subprocess probe mechanism the original catalogue lacked.
#
# *** THESE FIXTURES MUST BE RUN UNDER HERMIT, NEVER NATIVELY. ***
#
# This is not a preference. A hand audit of these fixtures ran them natively and
# concluded membarrier_query was BROKEN with an inert negative bracket. It is
# not broken. Natively it exits 1 BOTH clean and mutated -- because natively the
# host's real membarrier mask (1023 on kernel 6.18) is exactly the host-dependent
# value the fixture exists to reject. Under hermit, detcore normalizes the mask
# to its emulated set (31), so the fixture reads 0 clean and 1 mutated and
# discriminates perfectly.
#
# The general rule: a fixture whose contract is "hermit replaces this host value"
# CANNOT be bracketed on the host, because on the host the contract is genuinely
# violated. A native run of such a fixture yields a false BROKEN verdict. So when
# no hermit binary is available this probe reports UNAVAILABLE and declines to
