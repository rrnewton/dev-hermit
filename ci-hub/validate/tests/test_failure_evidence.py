"""Mutation-bar tests for the per-node failure classifier.

The P1 this covers (`one-gate-name-for-three-unrelated-causes-cannot-be-triaged`):
the `portable CI DAG manifest` gate reported THREE unrelated causes — a corrupt
DynamoRIO archive, a LiteInst nondeterminism, and a poisoned cache — under one
name and one exit code, costing hours of misdiagnosis. The bar: plant each cause
independently and confirm the classifier yields THREE DISTINCT verdicts, not one
name three times.
