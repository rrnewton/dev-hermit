"""Brackets for the green-class clause WIRED into the qualified-rows view.

`green_class.derive_class` had real logic and ZERO consumers -- it could not fire
in production (see ai_docs/phase2-tightening-guards-adversarial-review-20260805.md).
It is now a clause in `qualified_rows.is_qualified`, which IS wired
(`ci-hub/ci-hub.rs` -> `qualified-rows`).

Both directions are bracketed here, because a guard that only ever refuses is as
broken as one that only ever accepts:

  NEGATIVE -- a SOFT (inherited) green, and a row whose `green_class` LABEL has
              been laundered to disagree with its provenance, are refused.
  POSITIVE -- rows that predate the provenance fields (every row in the ledger
              today) still qualify, so wiring the clause rejects no existing
              producer. This is the fleet-flag-day failure mode the schema
              transition rule exists to prevent.
