"""Brackets for the `anchor_select` clauses found LIVE BUT UNTESTED.

The adversarial review (ai_docs/phase2-tightening-guards-adversarial-review-20260805.md)
mutation-tested the former local `row_qualifies` and `_coverage_satisfied`:
killing any of the clauses below left the existing suite green, so nothing held
them in place. Each
was then shown to be LIVE -- it rejects an input that no other clause rejects --
so they are missing tests, not dead code.

Every case here is built from a row that QUALIFIES at baseline and perturbs
exactly one field, so the refusal is attributable to the named clause and the
bracket cannot pass vacuously. The `test_baseline_row_qualifies` positive control
is what makes that attribution honest: if the baseline ever stops qualifying,
every negative below would pass for the wrong reason.
