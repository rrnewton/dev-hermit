"""MUTATION proof for the ledger `producer` provenance column.

Task `every-ledger-writer-stamps-producer-and-the-reader-refuses-rows-without-it`.
Establishing who wrote ONE row (the schema-4 correction carrying
`corrects`/`correction_author`) previously took JSON-whitespace forensics plus a
`git log -S` across three repos. `producer` is the column that makes that a
lookup instead of an investigation.

BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE ASSERTED, and the harness is built so that neither direction
can pass vacuously:

  * The REFUSAL direction is driven against a FIXTURE predicate whose epoch is
    SET, because the shipped predicate is deliberately inert
    (`applies_from_finished_at: null`) until all four writers deploy. A test that
    only exercised the shipped predicate would prove the gate compiles, not that
    it fires.
  * The ACCEPTANCE direction is asserted for EACH of the four registered writer
    slugs, so a typo in any one slug is caught here rather than at activation --
    when it would refuse that writer's every row.
  * The GRANDFATHER direction asserts the 729 pre-existing rows still qualify,
    which is the property that keeps activation from blocking all landing.

`row_qualification` takes the predicate as a PARAMETER, so every scenario builds
its own predicate dict and nothing touches the live file or the process-wide
cache.

        An earlier version of this test compared `known` against a hardcoded

        passed while the registry named `hermit-validate-rs` and the real
        `scripts/validate.rs` emitted the bare `validate.rs`, i.e. while the
        predicate would have refused that writer's every row. The slug is read
        out of each writer's SOURCE here, so drift fails loudly.

        hermit/ and reverie/ are submodules: assert when materialized, skip that
        writer (named) when not, and never silently count it as checked.

        THREE states per writer, not two. Deployment of the column is staged
        across three repositories, so "the file is here but stamps nothing yet"
        is a real and expected state that is NOT drift:

          absent      -- submodule not materialized. Skip, named.
          undeployed  -- present, emits no producer field AT ALL. Tolerated
                         only while the predicate is inert; a hard failure the
                         moment the epoch is set, because from then on this

          deployed    -- emits a producer field. Its slug MUST parse and MUST
                         be registered, else the predicate would refuse it.

        Collapsing `undeployed` into `deployed` is what made this test red on
        main from 9bf1143: it asserted deployment completeness before the
        hermit-side writer had landed. Collapsing it into `absent` would be
        worse -- it would hide a writer that stamps a field in a shape the
        registry cannot read, which is exactly the drift this test exists to
        catch. So `deployed_marker` is deliberately weaker than `slug_pattern`:
        marker-present-but-slug-unparseable is a FAILURE, not a skip.
