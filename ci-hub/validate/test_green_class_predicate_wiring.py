"""BRACKETS for the green-CLASS clause wired into the SHARED PREDICATE consumer.

Scope note: a concurrent agent wired the same `green_class.derive_class` into a
DIFFERENT consumer -- `qualified_rows.is_qualified` (reached via `ci-hub.rs ->
qualified-rows`), bracketed in `tests/test_green_class_wiring.py`. These two are
complementary, not duplicates: this file covers
`qualifying_receipt.row_qualifies` (reached via `history/query.py` and
`validation/publish_receipt.py`). Both delegate to the one derivation; neither
restates it. This file was renamed off the shared basename because two
`test_green_class_wiring.py` in different dirs without `__init__.py` collide
during pytest collection.

The review that prompted this recorded `green_class.py` as REAL logic with ZERO
consumers — "a bracketed classifier that no decision depends on cannot fail
closed on anything". These tests exist to prove that is no longer true, and they
deliberately go through `qualifying_receipt.row_qualifies` (the shared predicate
that `history/query.py` and `validation/publish_receipt.py` actually call) rather
than through `green_class` directly. Testing the classifier in isolation is
exactly the weakness the review named.

Every gate is bracketed both ways: the planted soft/refused row must be REFUSED,
and the legitimate hard population must still QUALIFY and be counted.
