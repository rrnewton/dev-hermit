    "no uncommitted changes" is already guaranteed — but `git status
    --porcelain=v1` says NOTHING ABOUT IGNORED FILES, and that is where the
    divergence lives. Measured 2026-08-08 on a slot at 393c6a765: `git status
    --porcelain=v1` reported 0 paths while the tree carried 5.1 GB of ignored
    build output, caches and materialized dependencies. A validate of that tree
    is a validate of the commit PLUS 5.1 GB of unrecorded local history, so the
    40-hex SHA on the receipt does not describe what actually ran.

    Two measured cases from the same day where ignored state DECIDED a verdict:
    an empty (gitignored) `hermit/agent-utils` made `scripts/validate.rs` die in
    0.045s in a way that reads like a fast pass; and a stale (gitignored)
    rust-script binary cache made a tree whose `git status` was empty fail
    `--self-test` on a mutation that had already been reverted.

    THE SECOND CASE IS ALSO THIS FUNCTION'S OWN FAILURE MODE. A fresh worktree
    starts with EMPTY submodules, `agent-utils` among them — so materializing
    the tree and launching without initializing them reproduces the 0.045s
    fake-pass BY CONSTRUCTION. That is why this returns only after proving the
    tree is usable, and raises otherwise: an unusable temp checkout must abort
    the launch, never quietly become a fast green.
