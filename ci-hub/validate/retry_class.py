"""Typed, fail-closed classification of a validate run's outcome.

WHY THIS EXISTS — a measured conflation, not a hypothetical one.

`ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py:340-360` decides a run's verdict with a
most-severe-first chain::

    fail > timeout > incomplete > no_result(zero tests) > pass-partial > pass

`interruption_signal` does not appear in that chain. It is WRITTEN by
`hermit/validate.sh` (:1422, :1525, :1574), asserted by
`hermit/scripts/test_validate_stop_paths.py`, and — measured 2026-08-07 by
grepping the whole parent — **consumed by nothing**. A typed fact is computed,
serialised, and thrown away, which is the same failure mode already recorded on
this task for `StepOutcome`/`step_failure_reason`.

The consequence, counted on the live 654-row ledger: of the 8 runs interrupted
by SIGTERM, **7 are stored `no_result` and 1 is stored `fail`** — an
interruption wearing a product-red badge, with `reclassified_reason` null. The
classifier fails OPEN into product-red, the most damaging direction: a
no-result that reads as a genuine red is what puts an automated revert of a
healthy main one step away.

THE SHAPE OF THE FIX. The offending row is not simply mislabelled — it is a
COMPOUND state. That run really did observe a product failure AND really was
interrupted before finishing its gates. One scalar `result` cannot hold both,
so one fact always dies; today it is the interruption. So the cure is not a
better `if`/`elif` ordering, it is **separate typed axes**:

* :class:`Completion`    — did the run finish under its own power?
* :class:`ProductSignal` — what did it observe about the product?

Those are independent. Every combination is representable, so nothing is
destroyed, and the four classes the drain needs kept apart — NO-RESULT,
CANCELLED, CONTENTION, PRODUCT-RED — are distinguishable by construction rather
than by a precedence accident.

FAIL-CLOSED means one specific thing here: an interrupted run NEVER certifies,
whatever it observed, because it did not finish its gates. It does NOT mean
rewriting its red into a no-result — that would destroy the product observation
in the other direction and could hide a real failure.

This module is a pure function over already-recorded typed fields. It reads no
logs, runs no subprocess, and greps no text — deliberately, since the
toolchain-dependent text-grep classifier is the thing this task exists to stop
relying on.

# COMPLETENESS IS COVERAGE, NOT A COUNT.
#
# The first version of this module decided GREEN from a positive executed-test
# COUNT. That is the REFUTED completeness signal: a count cannot distinguish
# "ran fewer tests" from "covered fewer nodes". Commit ee303899 carries 8 PASS
# rows at executed=427 that are NOT full greens -- 4 executed test nodes of 19
# planned, 15 absent.
#
# Reading that field here was caught by the executed-test-count consumer
# registry test under ci-hub/tests/, whose classification rule is explicit: a
# completeness or green/qualified key IS the bug, and must be rewritten against
# coverage.* rather than added to the allowlist. So this module no longer names
# that field anywhere -- deliberately, since the registry is a literal grep and
# a file that merely mentions the field still reads as a consumer.
#
# The completeness axis DELEGATES to the shared predicate one directory up
# rather than restating it. A local copy is exactly the drift that predicate
# exists to remove, and the tree already carries one such copy
# (anchor_select.py::_coverage_satisfied); this module does not add a second.
#
# Two coverage axes, different questions, both checked below:
#   coverage.*     per-node: did every planned test node actually execute?
#   full_coverage  profile scope: was this the FULL profile, not a partial
#                  `*-only` profile whose pass reads like a full green?
