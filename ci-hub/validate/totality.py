"""Decide whether a validate run was TOTAL, INCREMENTAL, or UNKNOWN.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The landing certifier
(`ci-hub/lib/validate_status.rs::is_clean_full_coverage`, lines 151-157) decides
"this was a full-coverage run" from five fields, of which the two that carry the
scope are ``profile == "full"`` and ``selection_mode == "full"``. Both record
what the run ASKED FOR. Neither records what it ACHIEVED.

That gap is not theoretical. In the live ledger, commit
``ee3038998fda5250904cb21a7f66a1ce245af87e`` (2026-08-04T03:16:57Z) satisfies all
five predicates with ``result=pass`` while its own ``coverage`` block records
``planned_test_nodes=19, executed_test_nodes=4`` -- fifteen test nodes, including
``test.strict_compat`` and ``test.detcore_misc``, never ran. A run that executed
21% of its planned nodes is certifiable as a total pass.

THE RULE THIS MODULE ENFORCES: a declared profile can DOWNGRADE a run to
incremental, but it can never UPGRADE one to total. Only observed execution
promotes. Where observation is missing, the answer is UNKNOWN -- never TOTAL.
Absence of evidence is the single most dangerous input here, because the
majority of the ledger has it: of 357 pass rows, 309 (86.6%) carry no
``coverage`` block at all.

EVERY VERDICT CARRIES ITS DENOMINATOR. ``executed_test_nodes`` alone is a count
without a scale; ``4`` means nothing until ``19`` is beside it. The returned
record always states both, plus which field decided the verdict, so a consumer
never has to re-derive the premise and a wrong call is visible in the record
rather than inferable only from source.

RELATIONSHIP TO THE TWO EXISTING PREDICATES -- read this before calling either,
because three coverage predicates in one tree is a drift hazard unless each says
what it is for:

* ``validate_status.rs::is_clean_full_coverage`` (Rust, landing certifier) and
  ``flake_class.is_full_coverage`` (Python) both answer "was this run DECLARED
  full-scope?" from ``profile``/``selection_mode``. That is the right question
  for flake classification, and it is the WRONG question for landing.
* This module answers "did this run OBSERVABLY execute everything?"

They are not interchangeable and they do not agree: measured on the live ledger,
``flake_class.is_full_coverage`` and ``is_total`` differ on 386 of 654 rows, all
in the same direction -- the declaration says full where execution does not show
it. That is expected, not a bug in either. Swapping one for the other silently
would either promote 386 unverified rows or reclassify every flake; decide which
question you are asking first.

    Precedence, and the ordering is the whole point:

    1. DIRECT EVIDENCE WINS. If a ``coverage`` block is present it decides,
       because it records what ran. ``executed < planned`` is INCREMENTAL even
       when the profile says ``full`` -- that is exactly the ee3038998f row, and
       any rule that let the profile win here would re-open the hole.
    2. A NARROWED DECLARATION DOWNGRADES. With no coverage block, a profile or
       selection that declares a subset is enough to call it INCREMENTAL. This
       direction is safe: a run that says it narrowed did narrow.
    3. EVERYTHING ELSE IS UNKNOWN. ``profile == "full"`` with no coverage block
       is NOT total. It is an unverified claim, and the whole defect is that it
       has been read as a verified one.
