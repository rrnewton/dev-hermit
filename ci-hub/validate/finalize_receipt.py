"""MAIN-REACHABLE validation-receipt COUNTS + per-node COVERAGE finalizer.

Produces the schema-5 `coverage{}` obligation (plus the aggregate
`executed_tests` / `filtered_tests` diagnostics) for a validate run, reading only
two things that already exist on `main`:

  1. the full safe-ci-dag-runner log (`[<node.tag>] `-prefixed child stdout +
     `[<node.tag>] ✓ PASS/✗ FAIL` terminal lines), and
  2. the PLANNED test-node set, read from the DAG manifests AT THE EXACT COMMIT
     via `git show <sha>:ci/dag/{portable,privileged}.json`.

Reading the manifest at the commit — WITHOUT running that branch's `validate.sh`
— is what makes this main-reachable and version-independent: the planned set is
the branch's own declared intent, but the finalizer that judges it lives on main
and cannot be weakened by an older PR-branch YAML.

Design source: ai_docs/bind-validation-counts-per-node-coverage-design_20260804.md.

The obligation (computed here, ENFORCED by the Rust consumer from the receipt):
  * ran/absent   : every PLANNED `test.*` node must have a terminal PASS/FAIL line;
                   a planned node with none -> `absent_nodes` -> NOT satisfied.
  * zero-executed: a planned node that emitted >=1 libtest banner must have
                   passed-sum > 0; a banner-emitting node summing to 0 ->
                   `zero_executed_nodes` -> NOT satisfied. A node with ZERO
                   banners is EXEMPT (legit shell/e2e/nextest node).
  * `filtered_tests` is a DIAGNOSTIC ONLY -- there is NO `filtered == 0` predicate.

The consumer's `coverage_satisfied` == `planned_test_nodes > 0 &&
zero_executed_nodes == [] && absent_nodes == []`. This finalizer does NOT decide
validated/not; it only WRITES the qualified row (carry the condition with the
value) so the Rust consumer can re-derive the verdict from receipt fields alone.

Usage:
  finalize_receipt.py --log LOG --sha SHA --hermit-checkout DIR --emit-only
  finalize_receipt.py --scan --ledger LEDGER --sha SHA \
    --selected-row-sha256 DIGEST --hermit-checkout DIR
