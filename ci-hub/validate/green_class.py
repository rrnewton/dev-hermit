"""SOFT green vs HARD green — the class of a ledger row, DERIVED not declared.

THE DISTINCTION (owner, 2026-08-04):
  HARD green  = validation actually executed at THIS exact head.
  SOFT green  = validation executed at an ANCESTOR head and is being
                SPECULATIVELY TRUSTED here (the head was rebased, nothing on the
                branch changed). "We DO speculatively trust rebased PRs that were
                green just before."

WHY THIS EXISTS, STATED ACCURATELY
----------------------------------
It is tempting to say "a soft green currently reads identical to a hard one, so
receipts are being laundered today." Measured at ci-hub HEAD, that is NOT what is
happening, and the real situation is worth stating precisely because it changes
what the fix has to be:

  * The validate ledger has ONE SHA field, `commit` (ci-hub/lib/records.rs:117),
    which doubles as "the head this row describes" AND "the SHA validation ran
    on". There is no `validated_head_sha`, no `inherited_from`, no soft/hard flag.
  * `qualifying-receipt.json`'s `require{}` has no class clause.
  * BUT there is also NO PRODUCER that writes an inherited green into the ledger.
    `validate.sh` and `scripts/validate.rs` both stamp the head they actually ran
    on. `ci-hub/landing/rebase_wrapper.py` does model soft-green as a confidence
    LEVEL — and it keeps its records in a SEPARATE store
    (`ignored/rebase-records.jsonl`), and its landability conjunction is
    `soft_green AND base_clears_floor AND receipt_present`, where
    `receipt_present` means `ci-hub validate-status --sha Z` reads VALIDATED at
    the PUSHED head. So its soft-green never SUBSTITUTES for a hard green; it
    gates on one.

So today's safety comes from an ABSENCE (no soft producer exists), not from a
GUARD. That is the fragile kind of safety: it holds until the first soft producer
lands, and three in-flight workstreams are each designed to be exactly that
producer — the test-selection green-inheritance anchor work, the clean-rebase
soft-inherit work, and any relaxation of the rebase wrapper's `receipt_present`
clause. The moment one lands, an inherited green enters the ledger BYTE-IDENTICAL
to a hard one, and no consumer can tell.

The schema-transition rule in this repo (version-aware acceptance) makes the
timing load-bearing in one direction: a consumer that starts REQUIRING a new
field breaks every producer that predates it — that is the incident that once
rejected 254 of 255 rows fleet-wide. Therefore the class field must be introduced
with a DEFINED DEFAULT FOR EXISTING ROWS, and it must be introduced BEFORE the
first soft producer, not after. Adding it now costs one derivable default; adding
it later costs a fleet-wide flag day.

THE DESIGN — THE CLASS IS DERIVED FROM PROVENANCE, NEVER FROM A LABEL
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A `soft: bool` (or a `green_class: "hard"` string) that a writer sets is a PROXY:
a carry-forward writer can stamp `soft=false` just as easily as a real one, and
the row is byte-identical to a hard green again — the same defect one level up.
So the authority here is PROVENANCE, and the class is a function of it:

  validated_head_sha : the SHA validation ACTUALLY executed on.  <-- load-bearing
  inherited_from     : present IFF validated_head_sha != commit; describes the
                       delta between that ancestor and this head.
  green_class        : a CACHE of the derived class. A verifier recomputes it and
                       REFUSES the row when the label and the provenance
                       disagree; it is never read as the truth.

`inherited_from` deliberately does NOT repeat the ancestor SHA — that is
`validated_head_sha`. Two copies of one fact is a drift source.

DEFAULT FOR ROWS WRITTEN BEFORE THIS FIELD EXISTS
-------------------------------------------------
`validated_head_sha` absent  =>  derive it as `commit`  =>  HARD.

This is a DERIVATION, not a guess: every producer that exists today stamps the
head it ran on, so "absent" means exactly "ran here". All existing rows classify
HARD with zero fleet breakage, which is what the version-aware acceptance
contract requires of any new field.

It is also the safe direction to default only because the OTHER half of the rule
is fail-closed: a row that DOES claim inheritance without carrying the provenance
to justify it is REFUSED, not accepted. A future soft producer that forgets to
stamp `inherited_from` also has to forget `validated_head_sha` to pass as hard —
and if it stamps neither, it has written a row asserting it ran here, which is a
producer defect a lint can catch, not an ambiguity in the reader.

THE DECAY RULE (owner item 3: name the boundary, do not treat all soft alike)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soft green is a bet, and the bet is not uniform:

  rebase-only          the branch's own patches are unchanged and the rebase
                       pulled in NO new upstream commits. Strongest: the tree
                       differs only in parent pointers.
  rebase-plus-upstream the rebase pulled in N new upstream commits. Weaker with
                       N — the ancestor's green says nothing about interactions
                       with code that did not exist when it ran.
  new-branch-commits   the branch itself gained commits. NOT soft green at all.
                       (Owner: "Add a commit -> it becomes NEITHER.")

Within `rebase-plus-upstream` the boundary is DERIVED, not a picked N: if any
pulled-in commit touches a force_full-class path (`Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`,
`ci/**`, `validate.sh`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.cargo/**`, gated workflows), the
blast radius is the whole suite and the ancestor's green covers none of it. That
is the same monotonic force_full boundary the test-selection decay measurement
found — where it fires, selection saves exactly zero and inheritance is worth
exactly as little. Such a row is classified `soft-force-full-touched`, which the
landing predicate should not accept even if it accepts other soft classes.

WHAT THE LANDING PREDICATE MUST DO (owner item 2)
-------------------------------------------------
Say which classes it accepts, out loud, in `qualifying-receipt.json`:

    "accepts_green_class": ["hard"]

Defaulting to `["hard"]` keeps today's behavior EXACTLY as it is, and converts it
from an accident (nothing soft exists) into a STATED POLICY. Widening it later is
then one reviewed edit in the one shared predicate file, and every consumer that
reads that file inherits the decision — instead of each consumer quietly deciding
for itself what a soft row means.
