"""A TOOL MUST STATE WHAT IT DID NOT CHECK.

THE CLASS, and its canonical instance
-------------------------------------
`scorecard-full-manifest-denominator` (closed 2026-08-01): a backend passing
131 of 194 tests rendered as a fraction of 28, because the scorecard counted
only the portable-CI lane buckets. Every parity figure was against the wrong
denominator and NOTHING LOOKED WRONG. That is the shape: a tool answering a
NARROWER question than the reader assumed, with no indication it was doing so.

THE RULE
--------
If an answer is SCOPED, the SCOPE IS PART OF THE ANSWER.

  "Consistent" is not "correct".
  "Green" is not "tested".
  "Enforced" is not "enforced everywhere".

A verdict that omits its scope is not a weaker answer -- it is a DIFFERENT
answer to a question the reader did not ask, and the reader cannot tell.

WHAT THIS MODULE PROVIDES
-------------------------
`Scope` -- the declaration: what WAS examined, what was NOT, and the
denominator (`examined` of `total`, and where `total` came from).

`ScopedVerdict` -- a verdict bound to its scope. `render()` always prints the
omissions, so a scoped OK cannot be quoted as an unscoped one.

`audit_scope()` -- the DETECTOR. Given a verdict, it refuses:
  * a partial view (`examined < total`) that declares no omissions;
  * any verdict whose denominator is unstated when it examined a subset;
  * a `total` that is itself a guess rather than sourced -- the denominator bug
    was not a miscount, it was counting the WRONG POPULATION confidently.

The detector exists because "remember to state your scope" is exactly the kind
of rule that decays. A partial view that forgets to declare itself is now a
FLAGGED DEFECT rather than an invisible one.
