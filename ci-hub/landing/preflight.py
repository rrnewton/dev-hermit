"""THE LANDING PREFLIGHT — the checks that must pass before trusting any green.

Every check here is a defect that ACTUALLY FIRED on 2026-08-04. This file exists
because the rules were being retyped into agent dispatches by hand, and a rule
that gets retyped is a rule that decays. Here they are executable, and each has a
negative test proving it refuses the bad case.

  1. THE SHA YOU WERE HANDED IS A CACHE; THE BRANCH IS THE SOURCE.
     Four handed SHAs went stale in one night, one of them quoted into agent
     instructions for hours after main advanced twice.

  2. A GREEN MUST CARRY A NONZERO EXECUTED TEST COUNT.
     `--features` gating produces a build that succeeds, a target that runs, ZERO
     tests executed, and a reported SUCCESS. Proven by planting a feature-gated
     fixture. N==0 is a no-result wearing a success badge.
     The previously-recorded KNOWN GAP -- "an EMPTY log still passes" -- is
     CLOSED here: absent, empty, and countless logs are all NO_RESULT.

  3. LANDING IS VERIFIED BY ANCESTRY, NEVER BY THE `MERGED` FLAG.
     Ancestry must be tested on `mergeCommit.oid`, never the PR head: after a
     rebase replay the head is NEVER an ancestor, and that misread 79 PRs as
     unlanded when 46 had landed. `MERGED` alone is also insufficient -- a later
     force-push orphans the replay SHA, which happened to ~12 PRs on 2026-08-03.

  Plus two standing traps that cost real time:
  4. An uncommitted `[patch."...reverie.git"]` override in a slot's Cargo.toml.
  5. A byte-identical branch already on the remote before you open anything.

DESIGN: every check is a PURE FUNCTION over data that is passed in, and the I/O
that fetches that data lives in thin, separately-testable collectors. That is
deliberate -- it is what lets the negative tests run with no network, and it
keeps each refusal reproducible from the recorded inputs rather than from a live
API that has since moved on.
