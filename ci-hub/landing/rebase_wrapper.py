"""ci-hub's OWN rebase wrapper: record `X rebased on main Y -> Z` and DERIVE soft-green.

OWNER, 2026-08-04: "ci-hub should have its own REBASE WRAPPER that RECORDS that
REVISION X WAS REBASED ON MAIN Y TO YIELD Z, with or without merge conflicts.
ZERO CONFLICTS SHOULD MARK Z AS SOFT GREEN MECHANICALLY (LAND!). MINOR CONFLICTS
become the JUDGMENT OF THE AGENT fixing them -- part of their report MUST BE
whether they judge the resolution LOW RISK ENOUGH TO KEEP THE SOFT GREEN."

OWNER CORRECTION, same thread: "even the safe no-conflict case has SOME RISK.
THIS IS PROBABILISTIC. IT IS NOT LITERALLY SOUND IN A MATHEMATICAL SENSE."

So the framing this tool encodes: ZERO CONFLICTS IS A HIGH-CONFIDENCE PRIOR, NOT
A PROOF. Git conflict detection is TEXTUAL and line-based; semantic dependency is
not. X adds a caller while Y changes the callee's contract == no conflict, still
broken. X adds a test while Y changes a shared fixture. X uses a symbol Y removed
elsewhere. Trait impls / type inference / feature-flag / macro expansion are all
cross-file and invisible to a line-based merge. So a clean textual rebase is a
LOW BASE-RATE-OF-BREAKAGE bet, and post-facto validation of the tip covers the
residual risk the rebase does not eliminate: land on the prior, verify the tip,
fix forward fast. The two halves are one system.

AUTHORIZATION RETRACTION (2026-08-05): this store is advisory planning
provenance, not landing authority. Its legacy `landable` field binds a receipt
only at result Z and a gate-floor check at recorded base Y; it does NOT carry
fresh Reverie identities for source X and base Y, prove that a server-side
replay actually used Y, or refresh the dependency ref atomically at mutation.
The disabled legacy `land-pr.sh` must not consume it. The minimal
`safe-exact-head-land` extraction must independently bind X/Y/Z before any
mutation; no field in this store waives that requirement.

FOUR THINGS THIS TOOL GETS RIGHT (each a Proxy-Binding predicate):

  1. SOFT-GREEN IS A CONFIDENCE LEVEL, NOT A BOOLEAN. `soft-green(zero-conflict)`
     and `soft-green(resolver-judged)` are DIFFERENT BETS. A consumer deciding
     whether to land immediately or wait for a tip validate must be able to tell
     them apart, so the level is carried WITH the value, never flattened to a bare
     "green" flag.

  2. A CONFLICTED REBASE WITHOUT A RISK JUDGEMENT IS REFUSED, never defaulted to
     green. An ABSENT judgement must never read as approval. The resolving agent's
     judgement (`retained-soft-green` | `needs-full-validate`) is a REQUIRED FIELD
     plus a non-empty rationale; omit it and `record` exits REFUSED and writes no
     eligible record.

  3. CARRY Y, THE BASE. A clean rebase onto a base BELOW A GATE FLOOR yields an
     UNLANDABLE Z even with zero conflicts (23 heads hit exactly that on one base
     today). Landability is therefore soft-green AND base-clears-every-floor;
     the base's floor status is carried in the record and RE-CHECKED live at query
     time, so a floor added after recording demotes a stale record.

  4. CARRY THE RECEIPT AT Z, THE *PUSHED* HEAD. This wrapper OWNS the whole span
     rebase -> push -> validate-at-pushed-head -> record: not just the rebase.
     THE PUSH REWRITES THE HEAD, so a receipt earned on the pre-push SHA dies with
     it -- and the merge gate checks the pushed Z, for which no receipt then
     exists. That exact gap cost an afternoon (2026-08-04): 15 heads rebased,
     pushed, marked ready; NONE could merge (`qualifying_count: 0`) because every
     receipt was bound to a SHA the push had discarded. No agent was wrong -- the
     missing step lived in the GAP between the rebase front (ends at push) and the
     lander (assumes a receipt). So `receipt_at_Z` is a FIRST-CLASS RECORD FIELD
     and a null there is VISIBLE (a missing receipt inside an assumption is not),
     landability REQUIRES it, and `eligible` RE-CHECKS it live by dereferencing the
     ONE receipt authority (`ci-hub validate-status --sha Z`). A push with no
     subsequent receipt is REFUSED as landable, never silently queued.

PLANNING CONSUMER: coordinators QUERY candidate heads (`eligible`) rather than reading
posted notes -- a query has no mailbox to miss, closing the producer-posted-to-
the-wrong-task gap (12 verified heads were invisible that day because a producer
posted to its own task). See memory: ci-hub-ledger-cannot-record-soft-vs-hard-green
(the validate ledger CANNOT record soft-vs-hard green; this store carries the
provenance the ledger cannot), rebase-base-floors-queryable-gate-floors-py,
merge-gate-v2-floor-invalidates-pre-floor-greens.

RECORD SCHEMA (ignored/rebase-records.jsonl, append-only, latest-per-Z wins):
  { schema_version, recorded_utc, source_rev: X, base: Y, result: Z,
    conflicts: [] | [files], resolver, risk_judgement:
      retained-soft-green | needs-full-validate | n/a,
    rationale, soft_green: null | soft-green(zero-conflict) |
      soft-green(resolver-judged),
    base_clears_floor, base_unmet_floors: [...],
    receipt_at_Z: null | { sha: Z, verdict: VALIDATED, profile, selection_mode,
      finished_at, slot, host, qualifying_count },   # bound to the PUSHED head Z
    landable, landable_reason }

SUBCOMMANDS
  record    Record a completed rebase outcome and derive its soft-green level.
            The mechanical zero-conflict path and the resolver path both funnel
            here; this is where refusal-on-absent-judgement lives. Binds the
            receipt at Z (best-effort snapshot; re-checked live by `eligible`).
  rebase    OWN the mechanical rebase in a checkout: fetch, resolve the base
            (--onto <sha> | --onto newest-green), attempt `git rebase`. Zero
            conflicts -> complete, record soft-green(zero-conflict) mechanically,
            optionally push, then bind the receipt at the PUSHED head Z. Conflicts
            -> abort cleanly, report the conflicted files, and REFUSE to soft-green
            (the resolver resolves, then calls `record --risk-judgement ...`).
  eligible  Advisory planning query: list (or test) heads satisfying the legacy
            soft-green + floor + Z-receipt conjunction. This is not landing
            authorization; safe-exact-head-land must bind X/Y/Z independently.

# The store's ONE irreducibly non-derivable datum is HOW the soft-green was
# earned: the confidence level, and (for a conflict) the resolver's risk
# judgement + rationale. Everything else in a record is re-derived LIVE from a
# shared authority -- the base floor from gate_floors, the receipt at Z from
# `ci-hub validate-status`. So a clean checkout on ANOTHER host can reconstruct
# every field EXCEPT this one. A machine-local JSONL cannot carry it across hosts
# (dbi's finding: two hosts each write their own store, each lander sees the
# other's landable heads as UNTRACKED forever). Publishing just this datum,
# content-addressed and keyed by Z, to the SAME validation-receipts branch the
# validate receipts already use makes the JSONL a pure cache: any host
# dereferences the durable provenance. Content-addressing (path carries the
# body's digest) makes a judgement UPGRADE (needs-full-validate -> retained after
# a tip validate) a NEW immutable file under the same Z/ prefix -- never a
# rewrite, matching the ledger's latest-per-Z semantics without mutable state.
