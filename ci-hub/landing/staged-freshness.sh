# Refuse a parent commit whose staged blob is an OLDER copy of what is landed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Attribution is not sufficient to make a commit safe. On
# 2026-08-06, three of 59 paths staged in the shared parent index were stale
# pre-fix copies; committing them would have silently reverted e9d433c and
# 8117b39c/c6265f5 while looking like ordinary cleanup. The staging was not
# malicious or careless -- it was a post-rewrite RESTORATION taken from a
# snapshot captured before those fixes landed. Correct owner, correct intent,
# wrong vintage.
#
# So the safe-commit checklist is three independent things, not one:
#   1. explicit pathspec            -- guards BREADTH (never `git add -A`)
#   2. no foreign staged change     -- guards COLLISION on a single file, since
#      in that same path              `git commit -o P` commits the WORKING TREE
#                                     content of P, so a peer's staged change to
#                                     P rides along under your message
#   3. staged blob not older than   -- guards FRESHNESS. This script.
#      what is landed
# The in-flight four-call-site conversion and guard flip cover (1). Nothing
# covered (2) or (3).
#
# THE PREDICATE, per path:
#   staged := git rev-parse :<path>            (blob in the index)
#   landed := git rev-parse origin/main:<path> (blob at the tip of the remote)
#   staged == landed                  -> NOOP, committing it changes nothing
#   staged != landed, and staged matches
#     a HISTORICAL blob of that path
#     on origin/main                  -> STALE, REFUSE and name the commit that
#                                        superseded it
#   staged != landed, unmatched       -> NEW, allow
#
# The historical-blob walk is what separates "older copy" from "genuine new
# work". Both differ from the tip; only the stale one is a state main has
# already moved past. A check that refused everything differing from main would
# block all work and be disabled within a day, which is why the NEW case must
# pass cleanly and is bracketed in the self-test.
#
# FAILS LOUD. A stale path is named, with the superseding commit, and the exit
# status is non-zero. A silent skip would re-create the defect this prevents.
#
# It only READS. It never stages, resets, checks out, or commits, because the
# owner's staged content is the only copy of whatever they meant to restore.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PRODUCING A COMMIT WHILE THE SHARED INDEX IS OCCUPIED (credit: hermit-det4)
#
# Do not touch the shared index at all. Two techniques, which compose:
#
#   (a) temp index + commit-tree -- build a tree in a private index file:
#         export GIT_INDEX_FILE=$(mktemp)
#         git read-tree HEAD
#         git update-index --add -- <your paths>
#         tree=$(git write-tree)
#         commit=$(git commit-tree "$tree" -p HEAD -m "msg")
#         git update-ref refs/heads/<branch> "$commit"
#         unset GIT_INDEX_FILE
#
#   (b) isolated detached worktree -- its own index by construction:
#         git worktree add --detach /tmp/land origin/main
#         git -C /tmp/land cherry-pick <your commit>
#         # push that single commit, verify with ls-remote, then remove
#         git worktree remove --force /tmp/land
#
# (b) additionally sidesteps a rewritten local main, because the commit reaches
# the remote on its own rather than depending on local main's state.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage:
#   staged-freshness.sh [--root DIR] [--base REF] [PATH...]
# With no PATH, every staged path is checked.
# Exit: 0 all fresh (or no-op), 1 at least one stale path, 2 usage/environment error.
