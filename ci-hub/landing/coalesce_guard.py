"""Refuse to coalesce a change whose PR was closed ON THE MERITS.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A coalesce wave selects constituents by "ready and conflict-free" (see
`agent-utils/skills/pr-landing-operations/SKILL.md`, "Choose a landing shape",
step 2). Neither property says anything about whether a change was DELIBERATELY
REFUSED. The constituent list is hand-written into the wave's body -- PR #1633
enumerated 23 numbers in prose -- and nothing re-checks that list against PR
state at merge time, so a closed PR folded into a staging branch lands silently
under the wave's single approval.

THE TRAP THIS GUARD IS BUILT AROUND: "closed" does not mean "refused". Measured
on rrnewton/hermit 2026-08-07 over all 128 closed-not-merged PRs, the CLOSED
state is dominated by successful outcomes -- 54 carry a named successor and are
safe to fold. Blocking every closed PR would be as useless as blocking none; it
would stall the normal post-coalesce cleanup, where constituents are closed a
few minutes AFTER the wave lands (#1633's 23 were all closed 05:31:45-05:33:03
against a 05:28:47 merge, each with "LANDED via coalesce batch-2 (PR #1633,
squash mergeCommit b7f9c713...)").

The discriminator is what the close says, not that it happened:

  SUPERSEDED  names a successor -- "#1913", "landed via #1633", "superseded by
              main 4b9202c2", "CLOSED WITH NAMED SUCCESSOR". The work survives
              somewhere identifiable, so folding it is at worst redundant.
  MERITS      says the change is not to be landed -- "Closing this
              duplicate/vacuous aggregate WITHOUT LANDING" (#1726, #1701),
              "Closing without landing after exact-head adversarial audit"
              (#1641), "Closing this unsafe aggregate without landing"
              (#1672/#1670/#1668). Re-landing it reverses an explicit decision.

FAIL CLOSED ON SILENCE. A close with no comment, or a comment naming no
successor, is UNKNOWN -- and UNKNOWN is refused, not allowed. 53 of the 128 are
in that state. The asymmetry is the whole argument: wrongly refusing costs one
human sentence naming the successor, while wrongly allowing re-lands work an
owner spent review effort rejecting, inside a batch whose single approval hides
it. This mirrors the task's own predicate: refuse any change whose PR was closed
WITHOUT A NAMED SUCCESSOR.

Note what this guard does NOT claim: it does not verify that the named successor
actually landed. It proves "an owner pointed somewhere else", not "the work is
on main" -- that second claim belongs to ancestry verification, and conflating
them would be the same proxy-binding error this codebase keeps hitting.
