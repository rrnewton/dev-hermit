"""Unit tests for the standing receipts x fresh-heads reconciliation.

The join is a PURE function with injectable certifier + floor check, so every
state (VALID / FLOOR-BLOCKED / NOT-CERTIFIED / ORPHANED) is bracketed offline
with no gh / validate-status / preflight subprocess. Both sides are exercised:
a qualifying commit lands in each positive bucket AND a disqualifying variant is
refused, so no classifier is silently inert.
