"""Mutation bar for task_pr_join.compute_join -- BOTH directions.

The join's stakes are asymmetric (an UNMATCHED PR invites a look; a WRONGLY
matched PR gets closed), so a negative-only test is worthless: a join that
matches NOTHING would pass it. Every test here therefore brackets both sides and
asserts counts, and the live-population test asserts a nonzero-but-strict-subset
match on realistic fixtures.
