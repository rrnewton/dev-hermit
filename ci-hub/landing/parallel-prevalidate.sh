# parallel-prevalidate.sh -- DRAFT (hermit-220, 2026-08-03)
#
# Removes the measured landing bottleneck: the lander was running full validates
# STRICTLY SERIALLY ("to respect box load"), capping landing at ~6-7 PRs/hour no
# matter how many agents exist. That serialization is a self-imposed constraint,
# not a resource limit -- the same class of error as `-j 2` on a 316-core box.
#
# MEASURED BASIS (do not re-guess; see memory validate-concurrency-ceiling-not-one
# and validate-box-resource-footprint):
#   * one full validate peaks at 1.98 GiB RSS  -> reserve 2 GiB/box (MEASURED,
#     NOT the theoretical `jobs_footprint_bytes`, which overcounts and would
#     artificially depress concurrency).
#   * admission code, driven against LIVE /proc/meminfo, GRANTs ~320 concurrent
#     2-GiB boxes before it QUEUEs (0.85 * MemTotal budget). CPU-mean bound ~130.
#   * every resource ceiling is >=100; the BINDING limit is the 12-active-worktree
#     policy cap. So concurrency up to the slot pool is safe by measurement.
#
# ARCHITECTURE -- the two phases were wrongly coupled:
#   1. PRE-VALIDATION (~9 min, the bottleneck): parallelize here, one validate per
#      OWN worktree slot (slot isolation is what makes it safe -- concurrent
#      validates in a shared cache collide on the DBI cargo dr_config.h race and
#      reflink cmake pollution; admission's memory gate does NOT address that).
#   2. MERGE (rebase+push+stamp, fast): stays SERIAL via the existing land-lock
#      FIFO inside land-pr.sh. We do NOT touch that -- serial merge is correct.
#
# Each pre-validate ASKS admission for a box rather than self-limiting. When
# admission says QUEUE/REFUSE we SURFACE it loudly and wait; we NEVER silently
# fall back to one-at-a-time -- a caller that quietly degrades to serial on any
# refusal reproduces the exact ceiling this removes.
#
# Usage:
#   parallel-prevalidate.sh --slots N [--pr-branch "PR:BRANCH" ...] [--land]
#   parallel-prevalidate.sh --slots 6 --batch batch.tsv --land
# batch.tsv: one "PR<TAB>BRANCH" per line. --land hands each GREEN PR to
# land-pr.sh (which FIFO-serializes the merge). Without --land it only validates.

# Admission CLI. Lives in agent-utils branch codex/dag-runner-core-allocator until
# landed; override with ADMISSION_CMD once it reaches a ci-hub-reachable path.
#
# KNOWN-INERT AS A PER-REQUEST CLI (proven 2026-08-03, hermit-220): calling
# `admission request` once per box from bash does NOT gate, because each CLI
# process reserves under its own pid then exits, so _reclaim_dead drops the
# reservation before the next call (two 400-GiB requests both GRANT; status shows
# reserved=0). A reservation only holds while the RESERVING process stays alive
# for the box's lifetime -- which is how run_dag uses the library in-process.
# THE REQUIRED FIX is an admission `run --mem-gib N --box X -- <cmd>` wrapper
# (mirroring `land-lock run`) that reserves, execs the child, and releases on
# exit, so the reservation pid == the wrapper, alive for the whole validate. That
# wrapper is an agent-utils change, SERIALIZED behind PR#8 -- not done here. Until
# it exists, shell-driven admission gating is NOT durable; the pool below falls
# back LOUDLY to slot-pool concurrency (measured-safe, every resource ceiling
# >=100 vs the <=12 slot cap), and NEVER silently to serial.
