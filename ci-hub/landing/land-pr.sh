# Shared single-PR lander for the FIFO-serialized manifest / e2e / backend-parity
# bucket. This is the DISCOVERABLE home for the landing sequence that used to live
# only in scratch/. It carries the three race-tolerance fixes below AND is always
# self-wrapped in `ci-hub land-lock run --child-deadline`, so the landing lease is
# bound to THIS bounded child's lifetime -- no hand-rolled `renewer.sh` loop that
# can outlive a dead agent and wedge the FIFO (the 2040-minute starvation bug).
#
# Sequence (while holding the land-lock):
#   fetch fresh main -> exact-head local-OR-hosted authority -> rebase
#   (union|plain, SKIPPED by --no-rebase) + push -> recheck the exact pushed head
#   -> derive the optional locally-validated cache only for a local receipt ->
#   bounded merge-gate poll -> gh pr merge --rebase (NEVER --admin)
#   -> ancestry-verify.
#
# Three fixes distilled from the 2026-08-03 stuck-gate diagnosis:
#   1. Trinary gate poll: PASSED lands, FAILED stops, and NO_RESULT blocks while
#      re-dispatching. PR statusCheckRollup is too narrow: it omits the
#      workflow_run-triggered dispatch that can carry the success.
#   2. The merge command is the mergeability arbiter, NOT mergeStateStatus (which
#      sticks at UNKNOWN); attempt `gh pr merge --rebase` in a bounded retry loop.
#   3. A genuine gate failure is never overwritten by re-stamping metadata.
#
# Boxing principle applied to ourselves: EVERY wait here is bounded, and every
# terminal bail emits a visible ABANDON signal (stderr + a role-tagged PR comment)
# so an abandoned PR never silently languishes (the #244 pattern). On any bail the
# `land-lock run` wrapper releases the lock so the next FIFO waiter proceeds.
#
# Usage:
#   ci-hub/landing/land-pr.sh <PR> <BRANCH> [--union|--no-rebase] [--agent NAME]
#                             [--gate-deadline SECS] [--child-deadline SECS]
#                             [--foreground]
#   --union          use the additive manifest union-rebase (union-rebase.sh);
#                    default is a plain `git rebase origin/main`.
#   --no-rebase      OPT-IN. Skip step 2 (the local rebase + force-push) and
#                    merge the already-authorized head as it stands. Mutually
#                    exclusive with --union. Rationale + how to re-verify it:
#                    see the step-2 comment. Default behaviour is UNCHANGED.
#   --agent NAME     lock holder + PR-comment role tag (default: hermit-lander).
#   --gate-deadline  bound on the merge-gate poll (default 1080).
#   --child-deadline hard ceiling for the whole land subtree (default: twice the
#                    gate deadline); passed to `land-lock run`, which kills and
#                    releases on breach. It must be greater than gate-deadline.
#   --foreground     diagnostic escape hatch; default launches under nohup+setsid
#                    with a durable timestamped log and returns immediately.

# The eligibility predicate binds landing to the validate ledger, but it honours
# two env overrides (CI_HUB_VALIDATE_STATUS_BIN substitutes the authority binary
# outright; CI_HUB_VALIDATE_LEDGER substitutes the ledger file, and also
# redirects the scan-finalize re-mint at step 4a). Those overrides exist so the
# predicate can be bracketed inertly -- but inherited into a real landing they
# make the authority "the ledger AND whatever environment the lander was started
# in". Measured: with CI_HUB_VALIDATE_STATUS_BIN pointed at a two-line `exit 0`
# script, EVERY unbacked/stale/tampered head returns ELIGIBILITY=VALIDATED.
# Clear them once, before anything reads them and before the detached re-exec,
# so the ledger on disk is the only authority a landing can consult. Nothing in
# this repo legitimately sets either for the lander.

# server-side regardless. The local rebase therefore produces nothing the merge
# needs.
#

# re-derives the exact-head authority at the NEW sha, and every exact-head green
# earned at the old sha is orphaned -- a rebase can only ever downgrade an
# already-authorized head to NO_RESULT. Measured 2026-08-07 on #1705/#1711/#1678:
# all three held what the former OR rule called a qualifying

# rebase would have voided the moment another team advanced main. Hosted-only is
# no longer sufficient under the named coverage rule. See also
# rrnewton/hermit#1812, where an unconditional
# rebase-and-force-push in the union driver amended main's tip onto two PR
# branches and landed #1188/#1209 as semantic no-ops.
