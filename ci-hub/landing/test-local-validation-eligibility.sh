# INERT both-sided bracket of the landing eligibility predicate.
#
# `local-validation-eligibility.sh` exposes the local-receipt predicate used by
# the local half of the exact-head local-or-hosted authority. The GitHub
# `locally-validated` label is a CACHE of that result; the ledger is the truth
# (#231/#243). This test exercises the local predicate DIRECTLY against synthetic
# ledger fixtures in a temp dir, then audits the production combiner and lander:
# no PR is read, no label is written, no merge is attempted, and no authorization
# artifact is ever planted on live state.
#
# Both legs are required, and the second is the one usually skipped:
#   NEGATIVE  an unbacked / stale-SHA / tampered / known-failing record is
#             REFUSED (proves the guard is not one that never fires), and
#   POSITIVE  a genuinely ledger-backed exact head is still ADMITTED (proves the
#             guard is not one that refuses everything).
# Counts for both sides are printed at the end.
#
# The exit-code contract under test (see lib/validate_status.rs Verdict):
#   0 ELIGIBILITY=VALIDATED      2 ELIGIBILITY=ERROR / usage
#   3 ELIGIBILITY=KNOWN_FAILED   4 ELIGIBILITY=NOT_VALIDATED
# The lander must land on 0 only; every other code is a refusal.
