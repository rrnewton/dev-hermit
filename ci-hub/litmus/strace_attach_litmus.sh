# strace_attach_litmus.sh -- INSTRUMENT for the no-ptracer acceptance litmus.
#
# THE LITMUS. Linux permits exactly ONE tracer per process. So if `strace` can
# trace a hermit run end-to-end, there provably is no ptracer in the path.
# That is POSITIVE, UNFAKEABLE evidence. "we removed the ptrace calls" is not:
# a silent fallback satisfies that sentence too, which is precisely how a
# backend can report success while a ptracer is still doing the work.
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS THE INSTRUMENT, NOT THE ACCEPTANCE CHECK. The acceptance task
# is deliberately gated behind the ptracer-removal steps so that nobody records
# a pass against the pre-removal state. Running this to CHARACTERISE a backend
# is fine; quoting it as an acceptance pass before those steps land is not.
#
# THREE OUTCOMES, DELIBERATELY NOT TWO:
#
#   ATTACHED                 strace traced the whole run; no ptracer contended
#   REFUSED-ALREADY-TRACED   hermit could not become tracer because strace is
#                            -- THE INFORMATIVE RESULT, and the reason this is
#                            not folded into ERROR. Collapsing it would rebuild
#                            the ambiguous zero somewhere new: a no-result and
#                            a real finding would share one value again.
#   ERROR                    anything else (strace missing, guest missing,
#                            yama/permission block, harness fault)
#
# WHY THE VERDICT IS NOT KEYED ON EPERM. `ptrace(...) = -1 EPERM` is ambiguous:
# yama ptrace_scope, a uid mismatch, and a dead process all produce it. Keying
# on it would be a proxy. The verdict instead binds to observable evidence:
#   - the EPERM must be on a ptrace op that ESTABLISHES tracing
#     (PTRACE_ATTACH / PTRACE_SEIZE / PTRACE_TRACEME), and
#   - yama ptrace_scope is read and reported, so a yama block is separable, and
#   - in attach mode, /proc/<pid>/status TracerPid is read directly: it NAMES
#     the tracer rather than leaving it to be inferred from an error code.

usage: $0 --backend <be> [--mode wrap|attach] [--timeout N] [--keep-log] -- <guest argv...>

  --mode wrap    (default) run \`strace -f hermit run --backend <be> -- <guest>\`.
                 Exercises the one-tracer rule directly: strace claims the
                 guest first, so a backend that needs to ptrace it cannot.
  --mode attach  start hermit, then attach strace to the live hermit pid and
                 read TracerPid. Independent second signal.

  HERMIT env var selects the binary under test.
