"""Emit the provenance of what a measurement READ, so a stale artifact cannot
pass for a discovery.

THREE STALE ARTIFACTS PRODUCED CONFIDENT WRONG READINGS IN ONE NIGHT (2026-08-07):

  1. A parent tree 273 COMMITS BEHIND origin/main produced TWO PHANTOM SCHEMA
     SKEWS. The emitters really did disagree with their targets -- in that tree.
     At origin/main they agreed.
  2. A `gh issue list --limit 400` that returned exactly 400 of 438 issues
     produced a FALSE "no duplicates". The 38 unsearched issues were invisible,
     and the answer was shaped exactly like a complete one.
  3. A hermit binary 23 COMMITS BEHIND main produced THREE FALSE NONDETERMINISM
     VERDICTS AGAINST THE GOLDEN REFERENCE, and a 60x-inflated comparator cost
     that had already spawned an 86-260 hour extrapolation and a cadence task.

WHAT MAKES THIS CLASS DANGEROUS. In every case the artifact was INTERNALLY
CONSISTENT and gave no signal it was stale. A surprising result from a stale
artifact looks IDENTICAL to a discovery -- same shape, same confidence, same
plausible mechanism to explain it. The reading is not wrong because the tool
misbehaved; the tool behaved perfectly against the wrong input.

So the defence cannot be "remember to check". It has to be an EMITTED FIELD:
every measurement states what it read, and a result with no provenance is not
reportable.

THE CAP CASE IS THE SUBTLEST OF THE THREE and gets its own emitter. A truncated
query does not error, does not warn, and returns a well-formed answer. It is
only detectable by comparing the row count against the limit -- which nothing
does unless it is written down. Every conclusion FROM ABSENCE ("no duplicates",
"no PR", "no orphans", "no other consumers") is invalid under a hit cap.

Pure functions plus subprocess reads. No writes, no network beyond the git
commands the caller already runs.
