"""Triage the UNKNOWN bucket for artifact-based closure. Classify first, close second.

Ancestry is STRUCTURALLY the wrong test for a research task: its deliverable is a
durable artifact, not a merge commit, so it reads NOT-LANDED forever and inflates
the drain. This finds the (task, artifact) pairs that `close-task --artifact` can
verify, and -- just as important -- the ones it cannot.

THIS DOES NOT CLOSE ANYTHING. It emits a plan. Closing goes through
`ci-hub/bin/close-task --artifact`, which independently re-verifies (file, inside
the versioned workspace, version-controlled, content commit an ancestor of parent
main) and refuses otherwise. Two gates, not one: if my binding check is wrong the
gateway still refuses, and if the gateway is wrong my check still had to agree.

WHY A PATH STRING IS NOT EVIDENCE. The failure running through this whole session
is a name that matches while nothing binds it to the fact it asserts. A path
mentioned in a note may be someone else's artifact, a plan for a file never
written, or a doc that has nothing to do with the task's Verify field. So each
candidate must clear, in order:

  1. NOT EPHEMERAL. /tmp and scratch/ are rejected outright. /tmp was reaped
     mid-session today and destroyed working binaries twice; an artifact there is
     not evidence of anything tomorrow.
  2. RESOLVES. The path exists as a file on disk.
  3. VERSION-CONTROLLED and PUBLISHED. Tracked, and its last content commit is an
     ancestor of the repo's origin/main. A referenced-but-unpushed path is the
     same failure as an unbacked label.
  4. TOPICALLY BOUND. The artifact has to be plausibly THIS task's deliverable,
     not just a path that appeared in the notes: either the note names it as the
     deliverable (IMPLEMENTED/artifact/deliverable wording near the path), or the
     task's distinctive title words appear in the artifact itself.
  5. SUBSTANTIVE. Not a stub -- a few hundred bytes of prose is not an answer.

Anything failing 2 is ARTIFACT-MISSING: genuine unfinished work, reported as its
own bucket rather than folded in with bookkeeping gaps.
