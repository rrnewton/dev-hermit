"""Does the commit's CONTENT survive on the target — not merely its SHA?

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
--------------------------
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main` proves the commit is REACHABLE. It does
NOT prove the commit's CHANGES are present. A merge resolved toward the wrong side, or a
reconcile that drops a hunk, leaves the SHA a perfectly good ancestor while its content is
gone. Ancestry is a PROXY for "the work landed", it reads authoritative, and it fails in
the CONCEALING direction: it reports success precisely when the content has been lost.

Measured on a scratch clone during the recovery-procedure audit: a two-sided conflict
resolved with `checkout --ours` gave `commit-reachability lost=0 of 2` while the other
side's edit was absent from the file. The losing commit stays reachable as a merge parent
forever; only its effect disappears.

`ci-hub/closure/landing_evidence.py` states the standing rule — "Landing is a fact about
`main`. It is established by ANCESTRY on a freshly fetched target." That rule is CORRECT
for establishing ABSENCE (not an ancestor => definitely not landed) and INSUFFICIENT for
establishing PRESENCE. This module supplies the missing half. It does not replace ancestry;
it is the second question you must ask once ancestry says yes.

THE CHECK
---------
For each hunk of the commit's own diff, attempt to REVERSE-APPLY that hunk to the target
tree. A hunk that reverse-applies is present in the target; one that does not is either
missing or has been legitimately superseded. Per-hunk rather than whole-patch, so the
answer carries a count and a denominator instead of a bare boolean — a partial loss is
visible as 7/9 rather than collapsing to "failed".

FOUR VERDICTS, DELIBERATELY NOT TWO
-----------------------------------
  ABSENT        the SHA is not an ancestor of the target. Ancestry already catches this.
  PRESENT       ancestor AND every hunk reverse-applies. Content survived.
  CONTENT-LOST  *** ancestor BUT one or more hunks do not reverse-apply. ***
                This is the case ancestry passes and this module exists to catch.
  INDETERMINATE the diff could not be computed or the commit is not readable here.
                A no-result is not a pass and not a failure; see the workspace-wide rule
                that a gate which cannot distinguish these has too small a verdict space.

HONEST LIMITATION, STATED BECAUSE IT BOUNDS THE CLAIM
------------------------------------------------------
A hunk that fails to reverse-apply is not PROOF of loss. A later legitimate commit that
rewrites the same region also breaks reverse-application. So CONTENT-LOST means "the
commit's effect is not literally present at the target and a human must adjudicate", not
"someone definitely dropped it". This check is a SCREEN that fires in the direction
ancestry is blind to; it is deliberately conservative, because the failure it hunts is
silent and the false-alarm cost is a review.
