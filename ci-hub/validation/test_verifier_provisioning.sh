# INERT both-sided bracket of the merge gate's VERIFIER PROVISIONING step.
#
# The gate does not run verify_receipt.sh from a checkout -- it fetches it into
# $RUNNER_TEMP and runs it there. The verifier is NOT self-contained: it reads
# its qualifying-receipt predicate and its producer-definition registration from
# sibling files. A provisioning step that fetches only the script therefore
# leaves those unresolvable, and the verifier exits 2 on EVERY call.
#
# That is fail-closed, so it is not a fake green -- but it silently turns every
# legitimate receipt into a refusal, and it presents as mass evidence loss
# rather than as a deploy defect. It was live: the deployed pin predates the
# shared-predicate refactor, so advancing the pin to any parent commit at or
# after 19a219f would have armed it.
#
# This bracket EXTRACTS the real step from merge-gate.yml and runs it against a
# STUBBED `gh` serving fixture content. Nothing dials GitHub, dispatches a
# workflow, or touches a PR (#243).
#
#   NEGATIVE  a provisioning step that omits either registry leaves the verifier
#             unable to resolve it -> exit 2, and the bracket FAILS.
#   POSITIVE  the real step provisions all three artifacts and the verifier
#             reaches a genuine verdict (exit 0/1, never 2).
#
# Exit 3 = UNAVAILABLE (no gate definition to read), matching the posture of
# test_gate_definition_binding.sh: decline to have an opinion rather than
# reporting a false red where the hermit checkout does not exist.
