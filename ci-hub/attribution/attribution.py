"""Flaky-failure ATTRIBUTION: turn "N/10 flaky" into a CAUSE with evidence.

A flake *rate* tells you nothing about the *cause*. Three causes present
identically as "N/10 flaky" and demand OPPOSITE responses:

  INFRASTRUCTURE       runner/load problem (a check wedged 2h44m vs a ~2-min
                       baseline; PMU-sensitive tests on a contended runner; a
                       backend unable to measure anything at ~470 concurrent
                       hermit procs).  => fix the runner/load; DO NOT touch
                       product code.
  HERMIT_NONDETERMINISM a real determinism bug in the product (the detcore_misc
                       vfork-reap race, 16-23%).  => highest-value fix; localize
                       it to a divergence point + stack.
  ENVIRONMENT          the guest read a genuinely-varying host resource (the
                       /sys/module/.../refcnt read on command_strict_verify: a
                       nondeterministic sysfs value that changes under load).
                       Not hermit's nondeterminism, not infra.  => determinize /
                       virtualize that read.

Conflating them means either chasing a product bug that is actually infra, or
dismissing a real determinism bug as "just flaky" -- we have done both.

This module provides two things the harnesses lack:

  1. AN EVIDENCE-CAPTURE PRIMITIVE (`capture_run`) that any harness can call
     INSTEAD of `... >/dev/null 2>&1; echo $?`.  On failure it preserves the
     full stdout/stderr, exit code, wall time, whether it timed out, and the
     HOST CONDITIONS AT THAT MOMENT (load average, concurrent-process count,
     CPU pressure, memory) into a bundle directory.  You cannot attribute a
     failure whose evidence was discarded; this is the prerequisite.

  2. AN ATTRIBUTION CLASSIFIER (`attribute`) that folds the codified signals
     into a verdict + the evidence for it:
       (a) FAILURE SHAPE      -- hang/timeout vs output-mismatch vs crash vs
                                 nonzero-exit vs harness/build error.
       (b) HOST PRESSURE      -- load, concurrent procs, PSI at the failure.
       (c) DIVERGENCE CLASS   -- for --verify mismatches, whether the FIRST
                                 divergence is a COMMIT line (schedule diverged
                                 => HERMIT) or a DETLOG line whose value is a
                                 host reading (=> ENVIRONMENT).  This is the
                                 `hermit log-diff` differential technique.
       (d) EXTERNAL READS     -- did the trace show the guest reading a varying
                                 host resource (sysfs/proc/time/rand/cpuid)?
       (e) LOW-LOAD CONTROL   -- the single most decisive test: does it still
                                 fail when the host is quiet?

The classifier is a pure function of an `Evidence` object so it is unit-tested
without needing hermit or a loaded host.  The CLI builds `Evidence` from a
captured bundle (and, optionally, from a low-load control re-run and a
`hermit log-diff` of two traces) and prints the verdict.

Design mirrors the sibling ci-hub tools (operational_health.py, stress_store.py):
stdlib only, exit code carries the signal, loud + structured on every path.
