"""The hourly prompt must invoke the delivery-integrity flags that exist.

Enforcement that nobody is told to run is optional in practice. `status-log.rs`
refuses a status whose text does not hash to the delivered message, and
`hourly-status-relay.rs` only closes an hour on a dereferenceable GChat record --
but a coordinator follows `hourly_status_prompt.md`, so if the prompt's command
templates omit those flags the guarantees are never exercised.

Worse than omission actually happened here. Before this suite, step 4 instructed
"Never change `state` ... including a more descriptive one like
`gchat_delivered`", which was correct under the old single-stage model and became
exactly backwards once `gchat_delivered` was made the state that closes an hour.
A coordinator following the prompt verbatim would leave every hour at
`wake_accepted`, get it re-woken to the attempt bound, and land on
`gchat-ack-missing`. Prose drifts out of step with code silently; this suite is
the binding that makes it fail loudly.

Everything here is inert: it reads two markdown blocks and two source files, and
runs no command, no network call, and no send.
