"""A new `executed_tests` consumer must not appear unnoticed.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `executed_tests` is a REFUTED completeness signal: a count
cannot distinguish "ran fewer tests" from "covered fewer nodes". Commit
`ee303899` carries 8 PASS rows at `executed=427` that are legitimately NOT full
greens (`executed_test_nodes=4` of `planned=19`, 15 absent nodes). Completeness
is decided by `coverage.{planned,executed,absent}_nodes`; a red is decided by a
named `gates[]` entry plus `exit_code`. `executed_tests` survives ONLY as a
diagnostic and as the grandfather floor for pre-coverage rows.

The correction was applied to some call sites and not others, which is the worse
failure: the surviving sites look correct, disagree silently with the fixed ones,
and nobody can tell which authority a number came from.

THIS GUARD IS THE ANTIDOTE TO THE RECURRING SHAPE — a hardcoded list of a
growing set (the backend lint covering 3 of 6 backends, the `-j` default defined
twice, the ledger path under three names). It does not judge whether a given use
is correct; a static check cannot. It asserts that THE SET OF FILES ALLOWED TO
MENTION THE FIELD IS EXACTLY THE REVIEWED SET, so a new consumer cannot be added
silently and a removed one cannot leave a stale entry behind.

That churn is real, not hypothetical: over one two-day window three consumers
appeared (`ci-hub/ci-hub.rs`, `ci-hub/pin/validation_gate.py`,
`ci-hub/remediation/protocol.py`) and two dropped away. A hand-maintained list
was already out of date when this guard was written.

WHEN THIS TEST FAILS, DO NOT JUST EDIT THE LIST. Classify the new site first:
  * producer / passthrough / diagnostic      -> add it, with its reason
  * grandfather floor for pre-coverage rows  -> add it, with its reason
  * a completeness or green/qualified key    -> THAT IS THE BUG. Rewrite it
    against `coverage.*` (greens) or named `gates[]`+`exit_code` (reds) instead.
The reference implementation is `ci-hub/lib/qualifying_receipt.rs`
`row_qualifies` / `coverage_satisfied`, mirrored in `ci-hub/qualifying_receipt.py`.
