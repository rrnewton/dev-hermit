"""End-to-end bracket for the nightly-stress P0 alarm path.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The P0 escalation in `ci-hub/stress/nightly.sh` was a silent
no-op for as long as it existed: it called `status-log.rs --append`, a flag that
script has never accepted, wrapped in `>/dev/null 2>&1 || true`, so the refusal
and the non-zero exit were both discarded. The alarm path *reported success
while emitting nothing*. That was corrected by hand, but nothing committed
proved it, so the next refactor could reintroduce the same shape unnoticed.
These tests are that proof, and they are the regression guard.

INERT BY CONSTRUCTION — no user-facing message is ever sent:
  * the harness runs against a THROWAWAY ROOT built in tmp_path, never the real
    repository, so markers land in a temp `ignored/` and the real durable store
    is untouched;
  * `tg` is replaced on PATH by a stub that records its argv to a file instead
    of posting a TaskGraph note, so escalation is *observed* without delivering;
  * the burst primitive is a stub emitting the documented CSV contract, so no
    Hermit workload is built or executed.
Nothing here reaches GChat, TaskGraph, GitHub, or the network.
