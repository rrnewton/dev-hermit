"""PORT-TIME TIMEOUT GATE: audit a node's budgets AT THE MOMENT it is ported to
run genuinely boxed under safe-ci-dag-runner.

WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A SWEEP.  If the timeout audit runs as a separate
pass after a port completes, it fails by construction: the generous wall budget
rides across the boundary, the port is declared done, and nobody re-derives
anything.  That is how a 600s wall budget ends up on an 8-second node -- not
because anyone chose 600s for it, but because nobody re-examined it at the
moment it moved.  So this is a per-port constraint, run as a STEP IN the port.

WHY WALL -> CPU.  A wall budget measures the machine, not the test.  Measured on
this corpus: under load the WALL max inflated 2.80x while the CPU max moved only
1.19x.  Porting to a boxed runner without converting the budget just relocates
an already-wrong number.

THE ONE CHECK EVERYTHING ELSE DEPENDS ON.  A declared budget is worth nothing if
nothing enforces it, and "declared but unenforced" is precisely the state this
work exists to leave.  In safe-ci-dag-runner the CPU-time monitor lives inside
`if let Some(c) = &cg` and reads cgroup `cpu.stat usage_usec`
(scheduler.rs ~600-628).  No cgroup manager => no monitor thread => a declared
`cpu_timeout` is INERT, silently.  So ENFORCEMENT REACHABILITY is check #1, and
a node that fails it cannot pass the gate no matter how well-derived its numbers
are.  UNSET on an unenforced path is honest; a derived-looking constant there is
theatre.

DERIVATION.  cpu_timeout = round(max(cpu_s) * 1.5), anchored on the distribution
MAX (not p95: the tail is what trips a ceiling), with >= 5 samples or the answer
is UNSET.  UNSET is a valid, correct answer.  A fabricated constant is a hard
failure.  The derivation itself is NOT reimplemented here -- it is consumed from
ci-hub/history/query.py:node_cpu_budgets, so there is one derivation authority
rather than two that can drift.
