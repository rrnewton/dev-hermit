//! The SHA-queryable landing / cache predicate over the validate-run ledger.
//!
//! This is the ONE shared artifact behind two owner P0s (2026-08-03):
//!   * `validate-result-cache-by-sha` CHECKS it (skip a validate whose clean
//!     HEAD already has a pass record), and
//!   * `lander-lands-on-local-validate-only` READS it (land iff a clean-validate
//!     record exists for the exact PR head, GitHub-free).
//!
//! One store, one predicate: hermit/reverie `validate.sh` WRITE the JSONL ledger
//! (`append_validation_ledger`), this module READS it. There is deliberately no
//! second table.
//!
//! ## The predicate (VALIDATED) — version-aware over a schema transition
//!
//! The full rule is "a green must carry what it verified" (AGENTS.md Proxy
//! Binding, parent da98bdd): a clean, commit-anchored, FULL-profile,
//! FULL-selection PASS with a nonzero executed-test count AND zero filtered-out.
//! But the PRODUCER TRAVELS WITH THE BRANCH: a receipt's writer is whatever
//! `validate.sh` shipped on that PR's branch, and older writers do not emit the
//! count fields at all. Enforcing the count clauses on EVERY receipt therefore
//! strands every pre-count receipt (measured 2026-08-04: 35/35 clean full passes
//! in the ledger flip to NOT-VALIDATED), identically to the bfb0a9ef anchor
//! transition. So this consumer is VERSION-AWARE: it applies the rule that
//! matches each receipt's declared capability.
//!
//! A record satisfies the predicate for a commit iff it is clean,
//! commit-anchored, FULL-profile, FULL-selection, `result == "pass"`, AND:
//!   * it passes ONE UNIVERSAL guard that holds at every schema — `executed_tests
//!     != Some(0)` (a demonstrated zero-test run is a no-result, never green).
//!     There is NO `filtered_tests` guard: a real full run legitimately filters
//!     hundreds of other-shard tests, so `filtered_tests == 0` rejected every real
//!     full green — it is DELETED and superseded by the per-node `coverage`
//!     obligation, which distinguishes legitimate full-run filtering from a
//!     narrowed-subset masquerade; AND
//!   * IF the receipt is count-capable (`schema_version >= COUNTS_SCHEMA`, i.e.
//!     written by a coverage-emitting writer) it is held to the FULL per-node
//!     contract: `executed_tests == Some(n>0)` AND a `coverage` object that
//!     satisfies its obligation (a planned test node set, none inert, none
//!     absent). Absent counts OR absent coverage from a count-capable writer is a
//!     writer DEFECT, refused.
//!   * ELSE IF it carries both counts under an old schema (`aggregate.py`) it
//!     predates per-node coverage but is held to `executed_tests == Some(n>0)`.
//!   * ELSE it carries NEITHER count — a genuinely pre-count receipt, or a
//!     producer that failed to emit counts. It proves neither nonzero execution
//!     nor bounded filtering, so it is NotValidated (an uncounted receipt is
//!     UNVERIFIED, not green). The former transition grandfather (accept an
//!     uncounted clean/full/full/pass) is REMOVED.
//!
//! Why the grandfather is gone: it was a bounded transition allowance that
//! un-broke the drain while no count-backed greens existed. That precondition is
//! now met — the backlog is backfilled to schema-5 by `finalize_receipt.py
//! --scan` and every landing consume-path re-mints count-backed rows from each
//! green's durable log before reading the ledger (see `ci-hub/validate/scan-finalize.sh`,
//! wired into `ci-hub/landing/{land-pr,parallel-prevalidate}.sh`). Measured on the
//! live ledger: post-backfill the removal strands 0 legitimate greens; the sole
//! refusal (ee303899) is a genuine per-node coverage fail it SHOULD refuse. See
//! `ai_docs/transition-design-executed-filtered-count-schema-tightening_20260804.md`.
//! Keying strictness on field PRESENCE (not the `schema_version` integer alone) is
//! deliberate: the live writers disagree about the version — `aggregate.py` emits
//! counts under schema 1 while schema 3 and 4 exist WITHOUT counts — so the
//! condition ("this receipt measured coverage") must travel with the value as the
//! fields themselves; the schema escalator exists only to catch a count-capable
//! writer that emits nothing.
//!
//! This is intentionally NEVER LOOSER than `hermit/validate.sh`'s own
//! `locally-validated` stamp guard, which fires only when
//! `VALIDATION_LEVEL == full && failures == 0` on a commit-anchored, non-dirty,
//! non-subset run (validate.sh:4161 with :283/:404). `profile` is `VALIDATION_
//! LEVEL` unless a subset mode overrode it, so requiring both `profile == "full"`
//! and `selection_mode == "full"` reproduces "level==full AND not a subset run".
//! A `quick`/`super`/`portable-only` level, or any `--only`/`--selective`/
//! `*-only` subset run, is fail-closed rejected: a subset must never masquerade
//! as full coverage. `commit_anchored`/`tree_dirty` guarantee the record
//! describes the actual commit, not a dirty tree (the tree is not the commit).
