"""Resolve the TaskGraph database ONE way, for every ci-hub consumer.

Before this module each consumer answered "which database?" for itself, in one
of two broken ways, and the two failure modes are opposites:

* A hardcoded literal (``~/.tg/hermit.db``).  When the predecessor session shut
  down, its database froze; the unowned-backlog census went on reporting a
  fixed 108 for an entire session and could never clear.  Loud, but wrong.
* An implicit ``tg`` invocation with no database named.  ``tg`` has no global
  active database configured, so with ``TG_DB_PATH`` unset it silently falls
  back to an empty ``tasks`` database: ``tg db current`` reports
  ``(no active database - using tasks)`` and ``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks``
  returns 0.  Every gate reading through it then reports a clean, empty fleet.
  Silent, and worse: **a monitoring check that goes quiet precisely because its
  data source vanished reads as health.**

So this resolver REFUSES rather than defaulting.  ``tg``'s implicit ``tasks``
fallback is never reachable through ci-hub: if nothing explicitly names a
database, that is could-not-measure, not zero.  This is the same fail-closed
contract ``ci-hub/taskgraph/unowned_backlog.py`` already honours, where a
database that cannot be read is ``state=unverifiable rc=2`` while an empty
qualifying population is a measured, clean ``0/0``.

Resolution order, most explicit first; every result carries how it was reached
so a consumer can print its own basis instead of asserting one:

1. an explicit ``--db`` argument
2. the ``TG_DB_PATH`` environment variable
3. refuse

Deliberately NOT a resolution step: a ``~/.tg/hermit.db`` compatibility
symlink.  A symlink would make stale literals work by accident and hand the
identical confusion to the next successor session; the whole point is that the
binding is stated, not inherited.  Subprocess consumers should pass
``child_env()`` so the child is bound to the same resolved path explicitly
rather than re-deriving it from whatever it happened to inherit.
