"""The REAL green gate for the Reverie auto-safe-bump.

`auto_bump.auto_safe_bump` takes `validate` as a callable so the atomicity
property could be tested without a validator. This module is the production
implementation of that callable, and it exists because getting "is it green"
right is harder than it looks here.

WHY THIS DOES NOT TRUST `validate-run`
--------------------------------------
`ci-hub validate-run` prints a FINISHED state and exits 0 in cases where it ran
NOTHING — a refusal shows up only in the durable log, roughly two seconds in,
with the run never having started. So an exit code from the launcher is a claim
about the launcher, not evidence about the tree.

The authority is the LEDGER, dereferenced at an exact SHA:

    ci-hub validate-status <40-hex> --json

and a green requires ALL of:

    newest_qualifying is not null
    newest_qualifying.commit == the exact SHA we asked about   (identity, not "latest")
    newest_qualifying.failures == 0
    newest_qualifying.executed_tests > 0                       (a run that executed
                                                                nothing is a no-result,
                                                                not a pass)

The `commit` equality check is the load-bearing one. `newest_qualifying` is the
newest qualifying record in the ledger, and asking about a SHA that has no
record can still surface a record for a DIFFERENT commit; accepting that would
green-light a bump on the strength of some other tree's validation.

WHAT A BUMPED WORKING TREE IS, FOR VALIDATION PURPOSES
-------------------------------------------------------
The bump edits manifests in place; it does not make a commit. The ledger is
keyed by commit SHA. So a bumped tree cannot be validated until it IS a commit —
`commit_bumped_tree` makes that commit inside the isolated checkout, and the
resulting SHA is what everything downstream binds to. Validating "the working
tree" without pinning it to a SHA would produce a receipt nothing could later be
matched against.
