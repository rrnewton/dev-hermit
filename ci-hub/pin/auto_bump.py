"""AUTO-SAFE-BUMP for the Reverie pin: automatic AND safe, so a pin is
semantically as good as always-main.

THE MODEL (#281). The answer to pin friction is never to float the pin — a
floating ref buys convenience by giving up the ability to say what was built.
It is to make the BUMP automatic and safe. Both halves are required, and the
earlier batch bump was moot because it had neither.

    AUTOMATIC — already exists: `hermit/scripts/check-reverie-pin.rs
                --update-to-latest` rewrites every derived pin site.
    SAFE      — this module. The update step is not the hard part; not landing
                a half-applied or broken bump is.

WHAT "SAFE" MEANS HERE, CONCRETELY

* **Atomic across every entry.** The hazard is real and was measured: 13 of 21
  entries updated, 8 left behind. A partially-applied bump is worse than no
  bump, because the tree then claims two different Reverie revisions at once and
  every consumer picks whichever it happens to read. So the post-condition is
  checked over the WHOLE derived set, and anything short of all-or-nothing is a
  refusal plus a rollback.
* **Rollback restores bytes, not "the previous value".** Every touched file is
  snapshotted verbatim before the first write and restored verbatim on any
  failure, so a refused bump leaves the tree byte-identical to how it was found.
  Re-running the updater "backwards" would not give that — it would recompute a
  value rather than restore a file.
* **Fail-closed.** Every exit that is not a fully verified success rolls back.
  An unexpected exception is treated as failure, not as "probably fine".
* **No floating refs.** The target must be an explicit 40-hex SHA. A branch name
  or short SHA is refused before anything is touched, because the whole point of
  a pin is that it names one immutable commit.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO. It does not decide the entry set itself. The set
is DERIVED, every run, from the canonical tool's own scope (`git ls-files` over
tracked Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock). A hand-maintained list is exactly the thing that
goes stale and produces the partial application it is supposed to prevent.
