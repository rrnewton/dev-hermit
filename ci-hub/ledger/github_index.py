"""GitHub commit comments as a per-SHA index over validation receipts.

WHAT THIS IS, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT IT IS NOT. This publishes a compact,
GitHub-visible pointer for each validation run so green/timeline/bisect tools can
ask "what happened at this exact SHA?" without a local ledger. It is a CACHE. The
immutable receipt remains the authority, and :func:`verify_receipt` refuses any
comment it cannot bind to a receipt it dereferenced and hashed. A forged, stale,
or relocated comment is inert rather than believed.

WHY COMMENTS AND NOT STATUSES OR CHECKS. Decided by measurement, not preference,
in ``ai_docs/2026-08-07-github-validation-index-mechanism-decision.md``:

  * combined-status COLLAPSES history -- three runs from two host classes went in
    and the endpoint most consumers read reported one. Disqualifying for a
    mechanism whose whole purpose is a history.
  * statuses CANNOT be rolled back: there is no delete endpoint, so a bad
    publisher run leaves permanent residue on real commits.
  * a status description caps at 140 characters and one index event serialises to
    ~329, so a status-backed offline cache is pointers only; a comment body caps
    at 65,535.
  * checks cannot run at all on a classic PAT (403, "must authenticate via a
    GitHub App").

The honest cost, recorded rather than buried: comments need the broad ``repo``
scope where statuses need only ``repo:status``. That is a real least-privilege
loss, accepted because history preservation is the point of the feature.

THE PUBLISHED PAYLOAD IS A LEDGER EVENT -- the same ``validate-ledger/v1``
envelope the team/machine shards use, not a parallel schema. That is deliberate:
one envelope means one verifier (:func:`ledger.validate_event`) judges what may
be written to a shard AND what may be published to GitHub, and it means
:func:`ledger.union_events` / :func:`ledger.fold` work unmodified on events read
back from GitHub. A second schema here would be a second thing to keep in sync,
and the first divergence would be silent.

PRIVACY IS ENFORCED AT THE WRITER, FAIL-CLOSED. The prototype learned this the
expensive way: a read-side check correctly refused to *index* an FQDN that had
already been published. A reader cannot unpublish. So nothing reaches the network
until :func:`ledger.validate_event` returns clean.

NOT A LANDING GATE. Nothing here may be added to branch protection or read as
merge authority; consumers must dereference the receipt and run the canonical
verifier. Publishing is opt-in (``enabled=False`` by default) so importing this
module cannot cause a write.

API surface used, all under a classic ``repo`` scope, no GitHub App:
  POST   /repos/{repo}/commits/{sha}/comments   publish
  GET    /repos/{repo}/commits/{sha}/comments   read back (paginated)
  DELETE /repos/{repo}/comments/{id}            rollback
