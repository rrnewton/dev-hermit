"""Invariant tests for the per-team/machine validation ledger.

WRITTEN BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION, ON PURPOSE. Schema:
`ai_docs/validate-ledger-team-machine-schema_20260807.md`. Section references
below (§2, §5, §7 …) point at it.

HOW THIS FILE IS MEANT TO FAIL
------------------------------
A TDD file whose every test dies on the same `ImportError` is indistinguishable
from a file with a typo in it, so this file is deliberately split in two:

* **Fixture/contract tests run and PASS today.** They assert things about the
  fixtures themselves — that the corpus is well formed, that it contains no
  owner path, that the legacy row arithmetic closes. If these fail, the test
  file is broken, not the implementation.
* **Implementation tests FAIL today**, each with a message naming the single
  invariant it exists to prove, via `needs_impl()`. They stop being red the
  moment `ci-hub/ledger/ledger.py` exists and behaves.

That split is the anti-vacuity property: a green fixture half plus a red
implementation half tells you the harness is sound and the feature is absent,
which a uniform wall of red cannot.

THE CONTRACT THE IMPLEMENTATION MUST PROVIDE (module `ledger`)
