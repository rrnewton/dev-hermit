"""Deterministic global union and green/timeline/bisect queries over the
per-team/machine validation ledger.

Schema: `ai_docs/validate-ledger-team-machine-schema_20260807.md`; the section
references below (§2, §5, §7 …) point at it, and
`ci-hub/ledger/tests/test_ledger_invariants.py` is the executable spec.

THE SHARDS ARE THE AUTHORITY; THIS MODULE IS A VIEW.
Every function here reads append-only shard files and derives something. Nothing
rewrites a shard, and nothing here is a place to store a fact — if a derived
answer and a shard disagree, the shard is right and the derivation is wrong.
That is why `fold` never mutates its inputs and why `run.correct` keeps the
superseded event rather than replacing it.

TWO SEPARATE CONCERNS, DELIBERATELY NOT FUSED:

* `fold` computes the materialized view. It applies every enrichment it is
  given, last-writer-wins per field, because the view must reflect the shard
  contents exactly as they are.
* `validate_event` judges whether an event SHOULD have been written. It is the
  thing that refuses an enrich which overwrites a set value.

Fusing them would mean a policy-violating line silently changes the view (if
fold enforced nothing) or vanishes from it (if fold dropped violations) — and a
line that exists in the shard but not in the view is exactly the data loss the
append-only design exists to prevent. So a bad line is VISIBLE in the view and
FLAGGED by the linter.
