Usage: ci-hub <COMMAND>

START HERE
  Begin with fleet-wide truth and ownership before narrowing the question.
  quickstart              Print the opinionated five-step agent workflow
  health                  Combine main CI, open PRs, and remediation obligations
  active-work             Reconcile tasks, owners, and live ORC agents

HISTORY & FORENSICS
  Ask what is healthy, which branch commit was last green, and where failure began.
  main-health             Query current main-branch GitHub workflow health
  newest-green            Find the newest gate-qualified green commit [default: --branch main]
  first-bad               Find a retained PASS -> FAIL transition for a cell or gate
  validate-status         Check whether one SHA has a clean full-validation receipt
  validate-run            Launch detached validation through ci-hub admission
  validate-stop           Stop detached validate-* user units and verify termination
  ledger                  Read canonical qualified views of the validate ledger
  local-history           Inspect local validate receipts across slots and worktrees
  history                 Query the retained GitHub Actions timeline
  refresh-history         Ingest fresh GitHub and local history into the local store
  validate-worktrees      Show registered worktree validation runs

PR & RUNNER HEALTH
  Inspect live pull-request admission, runner capacity, and host pressure.
  pr-status               Pull fresh open-PR CI status [alias: fresh]
  runner-health           Summarize self-hosted runners and recent workflows
  load-probe              Measure whether the host can safely start sensitive work
  tick                    Run due scheduled operational-health gates

LANDING & BATCH CONTROL
  Serialize landings and manage the explicit policy state that gates them.
  land-lock               Acquire, renew, inspect, or release the fleet landing mutex
  validate-lock            Box-exclusive gate: one validate/bench at a time (GRANT/QUEUE/REFUSE)
  apply-local-label       Label PR heads backed by a clean full-validation receipt
  ci-mode                 Inspect or change constrained CI admission mode
  batch                   Inspect or edit the named current CI batch
  ci-timeout              Cancel hosted runs starved waiting to start; reroute to local

POST-LAND REMEDIATION
  Arm, discover, watch, and resolve durable exact-SHA verification obligations.
  arm-land                Arm concurrent local and GitHub verification after a land
  verify-landing          Verify a PR replay SHA or commit SHA on a fetched target
  obligations             List open or actionable speculative-land obligations
  inherit-obligations     Let a fresh lander claim obligations from a recycled agent
  watch-obligations       Poll verifier state and trigger failure remediation
  record-obligation-wake  Record an ORC wake-delivery attempt
  resolve-obligation      Record a completed fix-forward or revert

Run `ci-hub <COMMAND> --help` for exhaustive flags and `ci-hub quickstart` for
the short operational workflow.

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

const AGENT_QUICKSTART: &str = r#"ci-hub agent quickstart

FOR: dev-hermit operational CI truth, local validation receipts, landing locks,
and mandatory post-land remediation. NOT FOR: product test implementation or a
portable CI engine; those stay in Hermit and pinned agent-utils.

1. Start with the composite health signal; never translate pending into green:
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub health
   Nonzero means open remediation, red CI, or unavailable evidence. Read the
   named component before acting.

2. Inspect the narrower source of truth when triaging:
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub fresh
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub main-health
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub runner-health --all
     ./ci-hub/bin/load-probe

3. Recover local validation evidence after an agent or pane disappears:
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub local-history --since YYYY-MM-DD
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub validate-worktrees --runs 10
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub newest-green
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub first-bad CELL_OR_GATE
   Receipts live under ignored/ci-hub and identify slot, SHA, profile, dirty
   state, result, wall seconds, and CPU seconds. Run newest-green immediately
   before each rebase; it rejects green evidence below the current gate-schema
   floor. First-bad reports unobserved commit gaps.

4. Treat post-land obligations as durable work, not notification delivery:
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub obligations --actionable
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub inherit-obligations --agent AGENT --session "$HOSTNAME:$$"
   Do not raw-admin-merge; use the documented land-and-arm path so local and
   GitHub exact-SHA verification are armed together.

5. Serialize fleet landings through the evidence-based mutex:
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub land-lock status
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub land-lock run --agent AGENT --pr PR -- COMMAND...
   Serialize box-exclusive compute (one validate OR bench, so load cannot forge FAILEDs):
     ./ci-hub/ci-hub validate-run --checkout WORKTREE --agent A --target SHA --pr N -- full
   Never force-release another owner. Dead-owner reclamation requires process
   evidence and is built into the lock.

Run from the dev-hermit root. Networked subcommands apply with-proxy internally.
Meaningful work prints estimated and actual wall+CPU cost; quickstart itself is
pure and performs no workspace discovery, filesystem writes, or network calls.
