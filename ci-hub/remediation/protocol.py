# A clean nonzero exit is NOT automatically a failing answer. Tonight three
# separate ENVIRONMENTAL failures — a sandbox EPERM on a re-validate, a
# BpfJailer denial of a `.o.d` write inside a DAG step, and a cold-build linker
# flake with zero tests run — each exited clean-nonzero and read as a product
# RED, and each was one automated step from reverting a healthy tip. The
# genuine failure was in the HARNESS, not the landed code.
#
# THE DERIVED DISCRIMINATOR (task cancellation_taxonomy_distinguish_self). The
# earlier attempt enumerated environmental root causes and defaulted every other
# nonzero exit to RED. That is precisely "a hardcoded list of a growing set":
# each NEW environmental wording we had not yet listed fell through to red and
# became one automated step from reverting a healthy tip — the exact failure
# mode that bit us five times tonight. So we DERIVE instead of enumerate, and we
# put the UNKNOWN on the safe side:
#
#   only a genuine, product-attributable failing TEST VERDICT makes the LOCAL
#   leg red. Every other nonzero exit — a build/link error, a sandbox denial, a
#   proxy drop, a disk-full, or an unrecognised failure we have never seen — is
#   a no_result: re-dispatch and (if it reproduces) fix the box, never revert
#   the tip on a local leg alone.
#
# This is sound, not merely cautious: a speculative land already COMPILED and
# TESTED the tip before arming, so a nonzero re-validate that is NOT a fresh
# failing test is overwhelmingly the environment (cold cache, sandbox, flake),
# not a regression in the landed code. And a real regression the environment did
# NOT cause surfaces on the GitHub leg too, which is authoritative and reverts on
# its own. The only "list" that remains is _TEST_FAILURE_MARKERS, and it lives
# in the SAFE direction: a marker we forget only downgrades a would-be red to a
# re-dispatch (recoverable), it can never manufacture a revert. _INFRA_SIGNATURE
# is retained ONLY to LABEL which box to fix; it no longer decides red vs
# no_result, so a missing category costs a precise log line, never a false red.

    Sequencing comes first: never arm a revert while EITHER verifier is still

    incident that armed ``action=revert`` on a local red while the GitHub verify
    run (30873193855) was still executing (obligation 20260804-025419-0f891e43).
    A revert decision is never made on a partial picture. (``pending`` — a leg not
    yet dispatched — does not block the authoritative GitHub-red path below, which
    is the intended safe revert; only an active ``starting``/``running`` answer is
    waited on.)

    Once both legs have reported, ONLY an authoritative GitHub red arms a revert —
    hosted CI does not flake the way a loaded local box does, and cancelled/absent
    is already no_result — so it remediates at once. A local red is only
    PROVISIONAL and NEVER reverts alone: a single (or even re-dispatch-reproduced)
    local validate that failed on a loaded/cold box is a candidate flake, not an
    authoritative regression. Beside a GREEN hosted leg it is a DISAGREEMENT
    (see ``_legs_disagree``); beside a NO_RESULT hosted leg — the COMMON case
    under admission-limited hosted CI, where the authoritative run was never
    admitted / cancelled below the concurrency cap / superseded — it is an
    UNCORROBORATED local signal (see ``_local_red_uncorroborated``). Either way it
    is surfaced for a human to investigate, never an auto-revert of a landed tip.

    History: reverting a healthy tip on a lone local red is the exact hazard this
    guard forecloses — three such recommendations fired 2026-08-04 (e8a0d8d3,
    0f891e43 x2), all caught by humans reading evidence, not by the actuator. The
    classifiers (_classify_local, _github_state) were already conservative; this is
    the ACTUATOR refusing to act on a lone local signal at all. This is the
    post-mortem's own remedy — a local box cannot overrule the authoritative

# How long a speculative-land obligation may sit UNRESOLVED before its silence
# stops being a normal post-merge window and becomes a hole.
#
# ARGUED FROM THE THING IT WAITS ON, NOT FROM HISTORICAL OBLIGATION LIFETIMES.
# I tried the obvious source first and it is contaminated: of 15 distinct
# obligations in the store only 9 carry both opened_at and satisfied_at, and
# their median lifetime is 235004s (2.7 DAYS) with a max of 296782s -- because
# nothing was resolving them, not because resolution legitimately takes days.
# Deriving a bound from that would either make the gate inert (2.7d) or fire on
# 89% of real obligations (900s). A contaminated denominator is worse than none.
#
# The honest reference is what an obligation actually BLOCKS ON: hosted CI
# reaching a verdict. Measured 2026-08-08 over the last 80 runs on
# rrnewton/hermit main (75 completed+success):
#     CI (GitHub-managed portable)  n=9  median 849s  MAX 1491s   <- the authority
#     P0 Demo Gate                  n=4  median 504s  max  610s
#     CI (privileged)               n=8  median 129s  max  185s
#     overall p95 1208s, overall MAX 1491s
# 1800s clears the slowest observed legitimate completion by 309s (~21% margin),
# the same margin shape as the github-main pending bound. Overridable so a slower
# reality can be accommodated without a code change.
#
# THE SAMPLE IS SMALL (n=9 for the authority) and I am not going to pretend
# otherwise. The asymmetry is what makes 1800s safe to pick anyway: too low costs
# a wasted check, and a genuine FAILURE is unaffected -- it pages at rc 2 at any
