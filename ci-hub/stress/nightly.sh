# Nightly Hermit determinism stress run — driver.
#
# WHAT: at main HEAD, run the shared concurrent-BURST probe for each workload in
# the stress set, then fold every burst through the flaky-is-red verdict and
# record one durable run per workload into the ci-hub store
# (ignored/ci-hub/stress-runs.jsonl). Any non-CLEAN verdict raises a P0 alarm.
#
# WHY it lives here (parent host), not on a GitHub runner: the flake this exists
# to catch is LOAD-DEPENDENT (multisect measured ~28% per-instance hang at 128
# concurrent under real fleet load; an idle single-tenant GH runner shows ~0% =
# false green). The nightly must run where the load is — this dev host.
#
# HARNESS SHARING (owner rule "do NOT write a second one"): this driver owns NO
# burst logic. It shells out to ONE shared primitive via $STRESS_BURST_CMD, whose
# contract is:
#
#     $STRESS_BURST_CMD <sha> <width> <timeout_s> <workload>  ->  burst CSV on stdout
#       CSV row: sha,short,build_s,burst_N,hangs,passes,other,hang_rate,STATUS
#
# multisect's experiments/.../probe.sh already emits that CSV; the only missing
# piece for nightly is a relocatable / --prebuilt build mode so a main-HEAD run
# does not collide with multisect's SHA-keyed worktrees. Until that shared tool
# is agreed & placed (see ci-hub/stress/README.md), $STRESS_BURST_CMD is unset
# and this driver records a RED "ERROR: primitive not wired" run rather than
# silently passing. That is intentional: a silent-green nightly is the exact
# failure mode this task exists to kill.
#
# ENV:
#   STRESS_BURST_CMD   command template (see contract above). REQUIRED to probe.
#   STRESS_WIDTH       concurrent instances per burst          (default 64)
#   STRESS_TIMEOUT     per-instance timeout seconds            (default 20)
#   STRESS_WORKLOADS   space/newline-separated workload slugs  (default set below)
#   STRESS_REPO        OWNER/REPO                              (default rrnewton/hermit)
#   CI_HUB_STRESS_STORE  store path (default ignored/ci-hub/stress-runs.jsonl)
#   CI_HUB_AGENT       agent tag recorded on each run          (default hermit-250)
