"""Is the nightly stress lane still PRODUCING? — the missing-run alarm.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
-------------------
The stress harness already alarms loudly on a bad result (`stress_store.py`:
CLEAN is the only non-alarm; 29/30 raises P0). What nothing watched was the case
where **no result arrives at all**. That is not hypothetical:

* The only live schedule was a USER CRONTAB (`30 4 * * *`). On 2026-08-06
  `crontab -l` reports "no crontab for newton" — the schedule is GONE. It lived
  in unversioned, machine-local state, so it could vanish with no commit, no
  review, and no alarm. It did, and nothing noticed for two nights.
* The GitHub `super` lane (`validation-levels.yml`, weekly) fired exactly twice
  and was CANCELLED at `timeout-minutes: 360` both times — 0 verdicts ever, and
  again no alarm, because a cancelled run produces no red to notice.

Both are the same shape: **the absence of a result is itself the signal**, and an
alarm that only fires on results can never raise it.

THE ONE NON-OBVIOUS RULE — FRESHNESS KEYS ON MEASUREMENTS, NOT ON RUNS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The obvious implementation ("alarm if the newest store row is older than N
hours") has a hole that the 2026-08-04 run walks straight through. That run
fired, recorded a row, and measured NOTHING: `CALIB_UNDERPOWERED`,
`instances=0, bursts_ok=0, errors=1`. Under a run-keyed check it counts as
freshness. So a harness whose calibrator is permanently under-powered — the very
fault that makes it stop measuring — would keep the staleness alarm silent
forever. **An alarm that the fault it watches for can switch off is not an
alarm.**

So freshness is keyed on the newest row that actually MEASURED something
(`bursts_ok >= 1` and `total_instances >= 1`), and rows that ran-but-measured-
nothing are reported separately as `no_result_runs`. A lane that is firing
nightly and producing nothing is STALE with a distinct reason, not fresh.

THE THRESHOLD IS A POLICY CHOICE, AND IS LABELLED AS ONE
--------------------------------------------------------
`--cadence-hours` is the schedule's own period (24 for a nightly). The staleness
bound is `cadence + grace`, and `--grace-hours` defaults to the cadence — i.e.
one fully missed cycle is tolerated, two is an alarm. That is a judgement, not a
derivation, so the output states the bound it used rather than presenting it as
if the data implied it.

VERDICTS
  FRESH        a measuring run inside the bound.
  STALE        the newest measuring run is older than the bound (reason names
               whether runs are absent entirely or merely not measuring).
  NEVER        the store has no measuring run at all.
  NO_STORE     the store file does not exist — the lane has never recorded.

EXIT CODES
  0 FRESH   ·   2 STALE / NEVER / NO_STORE (alarm)   ·   3 error
