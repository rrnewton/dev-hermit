"""STRANDED-WORK SWEEP: find work that exists only on this box, and rescue it
WITHOUT destroying anything.

Three confirmed instances of work stranded off main were each found BY ACCIDENT.
A closed task with a completion note reads as done: nothing fails, no check
fires, the artifact simply is not on main, and the agent that wrote it has since
recycled.  This tool makes that condition queryable instead of anecdotal.

STRANDEDNESS IS THREE TIERS, NOT ONE.  They differ in what destroys them, so
they need different handling and must never be reported as one number:

  T1 UNCOMMITTED  untracked / modified in a working tree.  Destroyed by
                  `git clean`, by a worktree reclaim, or by ANOTHER agent's
                  `git add -A` in a shared tree.  Most fragile.
  T2 UNPUSHED     committed locally, on no remote.  Survives `git clean`;
                  dies with the checkout.  This is the dominant tier whenever
                  egress is down.
  T3 UNLANDED     pushed somewhere, but the artifact a CLOSED task points at is
                  not on origin/main.  Survives everything except being
                  forgotten -- which is exactly what happened three times.

TWO MEASUREMENT TRAPS THIS TOOL EXISTS TO AVOID
-----------------------------------------------
1. THE SHARED OBJECT STORE.  Linked worktrees share one `.git`, so
   `git log --branches --not --remotes` enumerates EVERY stale local branch in
   the whole repo and returns the same number for every worktree.  Measured
   here: that phrasing reported 1050 per checkout, 54,706 "unpushed commits"
   in total.  The honest measure -- commits reachable from THIS checkout's HEAD
   and from no remote -- gives 63 across 14 checkouts.  A ~870x overcount.
   Always anchor to HEAD, never to --branches.

2. A STALE origin/main IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE.  When egress is down,
   `origin/main` is frozen at the last fetch, so "path not on origin/main" may
   simply mean "landed after our last fetch".  Reporting that as STRANDED
   produces false positives, and a checker that flags everything gets disabled.
   Absence is therefore reported as UNVERIFIABLE unless the ref is fresh; only
   presence is ever treated as definitive.

SAFETY CONTRACT (hard):
  * READ-ONLY on every path that another agent might own.  Every git read uses
    `--no-optional-locks` so a sweep across ~90 checkouts cannot contend on an
    index.lock with a live agent mid-commit.
  * NEVER runs `git clean`, `git reset`, `git checkout --`, or `git stash`.
  * `rescue` COPIES into a quarantine directory and leaves the original exactly
    where it was.  Rescue is additive; the owning agent still owns its tree.
