# prefix_depth.sh — PREFIX PARITY DEPTH: how many DETCORE COMMIT records into the
# INFO log a backend stays identical to the ptrace golden log.
#
# WHY THIS SHAPE. "does demo05 boot" is a BOOLEAN. It reads 0 for months and
# cannot show progress, so it cannot be ratcheted. Prefix depth is MONOTONIC:
# every divergence fixed moves the number up, so partial progress is visible.
#
# Y/Z where Z = COMMIT records in the golden ptrace log, Y = length of the
# identical leading run. Y=0 with a known Z is a REAL DATUM; no measurement is not.
#
# This is INFO-log depth. Today's published parity is STDOUT-ONLY, so this is
# strictly stronger and WILL read worse. That is correct, not a regression.

# through process startup and NOTHING about the guest -- which is why dbi=3,
# sabre=1 and liteinst=8 were constant while Z varied 2,765x. Depth is reported
# against the prologue boundary for that reason, and a depth inside the prologue
# is labelled rather than published as coverage.

# which is not where $H came from and is not even the same tree. $H defaults to
# ignored/prefix-build/target/, a CARGO_TARGET_DIR holding no source at all, and
# $HERMIT can point anywhere. So the old stamp described a checkout that had no
# causal link to the measurement, while looking like a precise 40-hex
# attribution. Measured 2026-08-07: the stamp read
# f89c69766371806d3c9b2c3003531df2d59d6118 (clean) for a binary that self-reports
# gf89c69766371-DIRTY. The SHA even matched -- only the qualification that makes
# it meaningless was dropped, which is the worst case: unfalsifiable because it
# looks right. ai_docs/measurements/prefix-parity-depth-ratchet_20260806.md
