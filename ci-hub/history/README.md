# ci-hub history store

The **single** local accumulator of commit/CI knowledge. Do not build a parallel
one — two independently-maintained stores drift (exactly how the hand-maintained
test-footprint map rotted). Everything joins by the documented file-contract
columns below; never import another store module's internals.

## Producers (`ingest.py`)

`ci-hub/history/ingest.py` — incremental and idempotent. Re-running never
duplicates a row and resumes from the last cursor. All GitHub access goes through
`with-proxy gh` (override with `CI_HUB_GH`).

```bash
ci-hub/history/ingest.py                     # incremental, both repos
ci-hub/history/ingest.py --full              # full backfill (recursive windows)
ci-hub/history/ingest.py --since 2026-07-01  # bound the window
ci-hub/history/ingest.py --repo rrnewton/hermit --no-profiles --no-local
```

Dispatched by the front controller: `ci-hub refresh-history [--full] [args…]`
(`ci-hub.rs` `RefreshHistory` seam runs this file when present).

Two ingesters run per invocation:

**(A) GitHub Actions runs → `ignored/ci-hub/gha-runs.csv`.**
Keyed by `(repo, run_id, run_attempt)`; UPSERT by newest `updated_at`, so an
in-progress row is promoted to its terminal conclusion on re-run with **zero
duplicate rows**. Timing is split because the hosted pool is queue-starved and a
single wall figure lies:

- `queue_s = run_started_at − created_at`  (time spent queued)
- `run_s   = updated_at   − run_started_at` (time spent running; blank until terminal)

Incrementality: the cursor `ignored/ci-hub/gha-cursor.json` records
`{last_created_at, max_run_id}` per repo. Every mode fetches through one
**recursive time-window fetcher**: a `created=start..end` window that saturates
(1000 rows — GitHub's hard per-query cap) is bisected in time until it fits, so a
busy drain day (>1000 runs) is never silently truncated. Non-terminal rows older
than the window are additionally re-fetched by id so queued/in_progress runs get
promoted once they finish.

**(B) Per-node CI profiling artifacts → `ignored/ci-hub/gha-profiles/<repo>/…`.**
Downloads GitHub artifacts named `ci-perf-*` (producer: hermit PR #1548, the
portable DAG runner) and unzips their `step_profiles_*.csv` onto local disk.
Idempotent via `gha-profiles/downloaded.json`. Until #1548 lands there are zero
such artifacts and this is a graceful no-op. Also refreshes the local
validate-run history via `ci-hub/validate/aggregate.py --write-global`.

## Consumer (`query.py`)

`ci-hub/history/query.py` — read-only, no GitHub access. Dispatched by
`ci-hub history …`.

```bash
# Per-DAG-node CPU-second budgets for cpu_timeout derivation.
ci-hub/history/query.py node-cpu-budgets --repo rrnewton/hermit --format csv
# → node, n_samples, max_cpu_s, p95_cpu_s, p50_cpu_s, max_wall_s,
#   suggested_cpu_timeout = round(max_cpu_s * 1.5), thin
# n_samples < 5 → suggested null + thin=true (never derive a timeout from noise).
# CPU seconds = step_profiles user_s + sys_s; node id = the `step` column
# ({group}.{job}). Reads local .safe-ci-dag-runner/profiles/ AND downloaded
# ci-perf step_profiles together.

# % of main-branch wall-clock time green (owner headline metric; DERIVED, never
# estimated).
ci-hub/history/query.py green-time --repo rrnewton/hermit
# state timeline over authoritative main runs; fraction of time conclusion==success.

# Default view: queue/run summary (the shape) PLUS the K most-recent individual
# runs behind it. `--since` works here (previously only on subparsers).
ci-hub history --repo rrnewton/hermit --limit 20
# columns: TIME(UTC) REPO RUN_ID WORKFLOW BRANCH/PR CONCL QUEUE(s) RUN(s) URL
# `!` marks a queue outlier: waited > max(300s floor, window p95) for a runner.

# Surface the handful of runs stuck for hours (the tail behind a p95=0 median):
ci-hub history --repo rrnewton/hermit --slowest --limit 10
# View the current queued backlog individually (agrees with the summary's
# queued=N count — same gha-runs.csv store, so no divergent numbers):
ci-hub history --status queued
# JSON for tooling (mirrors the local-history flag surface: --since/--json/--limit):
ci-hub history --repo rrnewton/hermit --slowest --limit 10 --json
```

The `--since` / `--repo` / `--branch` / `--limit` / `--json` flag names match
`ci-hub local-history` on purpose so the two history subcommands do not diverge.
The recent-runs listing and every other store consumer read the SAME
`ignored/ci-hub/gha-runs.csv`, so counts agree by construction.

## Local main-history queries (`ci-hub`)

The typed front door uses one Rust history index for both directions; neither
command reruns validation:

```bash
# Most recent main commit whose latest clean, anchored local run passed.
ci-hub/ci-hub newest-green

# Newest retained PASS -> FAIL transition for an outer gate, DAG node, or test.
ci-hub/ci-hub first-bad liteinst_detcore_strict_verify_micro_suite
```

`newest-green` defaults to `--branch main` and prints the exact profile and
selection mode. A full/full
result is labelled `full`; a smart-selected or narrower-profile run is labelled
with that weaker guarantee. It also counts newer commits with no ledger record.
Its cache is keyed by both the fetched `origin/main` tip and the ledger length +
modification time, so a new main commit or a newly appended validation record
invalidates it. Use `--no-fetch` only for an intentionally offline snapshot.

`first-bad` reports both endpoints, unobserved commits between them, the files
touched by the candidate, and a conservative plausibility statement. Inner DAG
nodes, Rust test functions, and their error excerpt are recovered through the
log path stored in the same ledger row. Once observed, that detail is retained
without time-based expiry in `ignored/ci-hub/local-cell-evidence-cache.json`,
keyed to the source ledger row; it cannot create a verdict for a missing row.
If a historical log vanished before its first indexing, the command says the
cell detail was not retained and never turns absence into a pass. Host load was
not stored by schema 3, so only the measured run CPU/wall ratio can currently be
reported.

Both commands follow `validate-status` exit codes: `0` found the requested
evidence, `3` found failure evidence without the required green boundary, and
`4` means no qualifying record/transition. Tool-cost output reports estimated
and actual wall and CPU time on every completion path.

**Queued-run wait (`>=N`).** A still-queued run has `run_started_at == created_at`
(a GitHub placeholder), so its stored `queue_s` is `0` even after hours in the
queue — a silent wrong reading. The listing therefore shows `>=N` for a queued
run, where `N = snapshot_mtime - created_at` ("still queued as of our last
refresh, so it waited at least this long"). This is an OFFLINE lower bound
anchored to the snapshot, not a live `now - created_at` (which would trust a
possibly-stale status). It can only understate, never overstate, the current
wait. `queue_s` and its percentiles stay measured-terminal-only; the lower bound
is a separate `queue_lower_bound_s` field in `--json`. The `!` outlier flag uses
the effective wait (measured for terminal runs, lower bound for queued), so a
run stuck in the queue is flagged instead of reading `0`. See
`ai_docs/ci-hub-history-queued-wait-lower-bound_20260803.md` for the reasoning.

`green-time` implements a dated four-state definition (see the `GREEN-TIME
DEFINITION` block at the top of `query.py`, `GREEN_TIME_DEFINITION_DATE`). Main's
wall-clock is partitioned into **green / red / no_result / gap**, where **green
is a positive success record, never the absence of red**. `success`/`neutral` ->
green; a genuine failing verdict -> red; `cancelled`/`skipped`/`stale`/unknown ->
no_result (a destroyed or withheld answer, re-dispatch not revert); pending or
no-record -> gap. green requires ALL authoritative workflows to succeed
(precedence red > gap > no_result > green).

The definition names a **seven-case taxonomy** so "not red" is not collapsed into
one bucket: cancelled-below-cap (supersede/manual) is no_result, cancelled-at-cap
(self-timeout kill) is red, environmental/harness-caused failure is no_result,
and the **seventh case** — a run-level `cancelled` that masks a *job* which
failed first — is red, discriminated by **ordering** (the job's red conclusion
completed at/before the run's cancel moment). Cases that the run-level store
cannot yet discriminate (self-timeout annotation; per-job failure) stay
conservatively in no_result, so an offline blind spot can only UNDER-count red,
never inflate green. The seventh-case discriminator (`_resolve_cancelled_run`) is
LIVE: `ingest.py` produces the per-job store `gha-jobs.csv`, scoped to cancelled
authoritative-main runs (the only runs where the case can fire), so a masked job
failure is now recovered as red. Being non-green, the promotion moves the
red<->no_result split (which drives action) without ever changing green_pct. A
run cancelled while still queued has zero jobs and correctly stays no_result; a
fetched-set sidecar (`gha-jobs-fetched.json`) makes the ingest O(new cancelled
runs). Skip it with `ingest.py --no-jobs`; `--refetch-jobs` forces a re-fetch.

The store preserves every conclusion and timestamp, so a refined definition can
be recomputed later without re-ingesting. Authoritative workflow defaults: hermit
`CI (GitHub-managed portable)`, reverie `Rust`; override with `--workflow`
(repeatable). Use `--trend {day,week}` for the trend and `--append-log` to
persist a durable JSONL snapshot per run.

## Join keys (file contract — join ONLY via these)

| concept            | gha-runs.csv | local (`validate-run-global.jsonl`) | obligations.jsonl |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| commit             | `head_sha`   | `commit`                            | `landed_sha`      |
| GHA run id         | `run_id`     | —                                   | `github.run_ids`  |
| repo               | `repo`       | (same string)                       | `repo`            |

All commit values are the same 40-hex SHA; `repo` is the same `OWNER/REPO` string
everywhere. `obligations.py` (owner: speculative-land) and the `submodule-bumps`
stream stay separate stores and join by these columns only.

## Live consumers

1. **cpu_timeout derivation** (`ci-timeout-audit-cpu-time-manifest-node`,
   `enable-cgroups-and-cpu-timeouts-across-dag-nodes`) consumes
   `node-cpu-budgets`. Nodes with ≥5 samples get a suggested timeout; the rest
   stay UNSET (thin) rather than guessed. Real per-node CPU rows arrive once
   #1548 lands and profiling artifacts are ingested.
2. **Owner's "% time green on main"** consumes `green-time`, derived from
   `gha-runs.csv`.

## Tests

`python3 -m unittest test_history` (in `tests/`). Offline: synthetic CSVs cover
the queue/run split, UPSERT idempotency, node-budget aggregation + thin flag, and
the green-time interval computation.
