"""Alarm when a validate run's CPU time regresses against a rolling baseline.

Owner's requirement: "We do not want to be in this place again where validate
becomes super slow and we wait on it in our inner loop blindly." This makes the
drift detectable instead of discovered months later.

WHY CPU AND NOT WALL. Measured on the live ledger (657 runs): CPU median 798s vs
wall median 193s, CPU p90 4621s vs wall p90 681s. The DAG is heavily parallel, so
wall is dominated by how contended the box was and CPU is not -- under 2x
oversubscription wall max inflated 2.80x while CPU max moved only 1.19x. So CPU
is the regression signal and wall is reported alongside it for human latency,
never gated on.

SCOPE, STATED UP FRONT: this ratchets TOTAL run time only. Per-node ratcheting is
deliberately absent because it cannot yet be done honestly -- `dag_jobs` is
populated on 190/657 runs (28.9%), and a p90 over a 29% sample is a biased
number, not a baseline. Gating on it would produce a threshold nobody trusts,
which gets muted, which is the failure this tool exists to prevent. Raise
per-node coverage to parity with total-time coverage (99.7%) first.

DEFAULT IS REPORT-ONLY. `--gate` is opt-in. A new blocking authority over landing
should be switched on deliberately once its baseline has been watched for a
while, not on the commit that introduces it.
