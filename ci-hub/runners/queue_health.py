"""GitHub Actions queue-depth, wait-time, and last-green health for the Hermit repos.

Non-mutating. Answers four operational questions the bare `runner-health`
histogram could not, keeping *time in queue* strictly separate from *run
duration* (the hosted/self-hosted pools are queue-starved, so conflating the two
poisons every downstream analysis):

  1. QUEUE DEPTH per workflow      — how many runs are queued vs already running.
  2. WAIT TIMES                    — time-in-queue distribution, reported apart
                                     from run duration. Two independent bases:
                                       * current queue age  = now - run.createdAt
                                         for still-queued runs (a *lower bound* on
                                         each run's final wait; free from the run
                                         list);
                                       * historical time-in-queue = per-job
                                         (started_at - created_at) from the jobs
                                         API over a bounded sample of recent
                                         COMPLETED runs (the true runner-pickup
                                         latency; run-level `startedAt` equals
                                         `createdAt` and cannot be used).
  3. TIME SINCE LAST GREEN         — per workflow, both the elapsed wall time and
                                     HOW MANY RUNS BACK the last success was, so a
                                     green that is three pages deep surfaces here.
  4. SELF-HOSTED RUNNER HEALTH     — CONFIGURED vs LIVE (a registered-but-offline
                                     runner is silently-dead capacity), busy/idle,
                                     labels, and whether the single serial PMU
                                     lane (`pmu-serial`) is the binding
                                     constraint.
  5. NAMED IN-FLIGHT RUNS          — "run X on branch Y", not "something is
                                     running".
  6. LAST-WINDOW RUN AGGREGATES    — started/completed/success/failure/cancelled
                                     over a fixed window, with MERGE-GATE runs
                                     counted SEPARATELY so gate churn never swamps
                                     the real test-failure count.
  7. SELF-HOSTED UTILIZATION       — busy-runner-time as a PERCENTAGE OF CAPACITY,
                                     and PEAK observed concurrent jobs vs the
                                     runner count (the "can we delete a runner?"
                                     signal). Both are computed over a fixed
                                     window from the bounded jobs-API sample, so a
                                     truncated sample yields a strict LOWER BOUND;
                                     each figure states the DIRECTION of its own
                                     error and never a bare percentage.

Every number is derived with its basis stated, per the workspace honesty rule.

This module is importable (used by `ci-status.py` for the human report and by
`ci-hub/health/operational_health.py queue-health` for the ops tick). `gh` is
invoked through `$GH` (default "with-proxy gh") so it works behind the devserver
proxy without touching the machine-global gh account.

Design note: this is the dev-hermit equivalent of the self-hosted+GitHub CI
"stats" reporting a sibling project surfaced via a Makefile target; that target
was never ported here (see runners/README.md). This ports the *capability* into
ci-hub, wired to the tick, rather than the target.
