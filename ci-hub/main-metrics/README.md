# main-metrics: validate WALL as a standing main-branch series

`ci/wall-budget-600s` asks *"was this run slow?"*. It catches a slow run and is
blind to the question the owner actually asked: **did a change make everything
slower?** A migration-shaped regression arrives with a commit and is invisible
without a series to compare against — which is exactly why *"did the DAG
migration make validate slower"* could not be answered.

This is the other half, and the sibling of `ci-hub/greentime`. Green-time and
wall-time are the two standing health numbers.

```
python3 ci-hub/main-metrics/wall_series.py                 # main-only, full-profile passes
python3 ci-hub/main-metrics/wall_series.py --format json
python3 ci-hub/main-metrics/wall_series.py --all-commits   # include PR heads
python3 ci-hub/main-metrics/wall_series.py --fail-over-budget
```

## What it measures, and what it refuses to

Per main commit: **wall** (primary), **CPU seconds**, **CPU/wall ratio**,
**concurrency at run time**, **per-gate wall**, and **peak memory** — reported as
`null`, because nothing produces it (see below).

Two refusals are deliberate:

- **Ancestry, not a branch label.** "Is this commit on main" is answered by
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor` at read time, not by a label the row recorded
  when it ran. A row produced on a branch that later landed *is* main history;
  a label written at run time cannot know that.
- **`INSUFFICIENT` instead of a guess.** A wall time without its concurrency is
  uninterpretable. Median wall measured **490s at 0–3 concurrent validates and
  852s at 14+**, so comparing two unconditioned samples can manufacture a 74%
  "regression" out of scheduling alone. `compare()` returns `INSUFFICIENT` unless
  both sides carry concurrency. `require_conditioned=False` overrides it
  explicitly, never silently.

**CPU/wall separates the two causes.** Wall up with the ratio *down* is
CONTENTION — we waited. Wall up with the ratio *held or risen* is MORE WORK — we
did more. Reporting wall alone cannot distinguish them, so the ratio travels with
the verdict and is named in `cause`.

## Measured state of the series, 2026-08-07

All counts carry their denominator.

| quantity | value |
| --- | --- |
| ledger rows | 691 |
| rows on main (ancestry-checked) | 132 / 691 (19.1%) |
| main **full-profile pass** points | 26 |
| distinct main commits with a point | **15** |
| span | 2026-08-03 → 2026-08-07 (4.38 days) |
| wall median / min / max | 659s / 396s / 995s (n=26) |
| **over the 600s budget** | **15 / 26** |
| CPU/wall ratio median (main full-pass) | 7.2× |
| **conditioned (carry concurrency)** | **4 / 26** |
| peak memory | **absent — no producer** |

Two of those numbers are the finding:

1. **The comparable series is 4 points, not 26.** `concurrent_validates` is
   present on 210/691 rows overall (30.4%) and on only 4 of the 26 main points.
   The UNKNOWN bucket is the majority, not a corner case.
2. **The median on main already exceeds the budget** (659s vs 600s), with 15 of
   26 points over. That is a standing condition, not a spike.

Note the ratio differs by population: 2.77× across all 691 rows, 7.2× across main
full-pass rows. Main points are the full DAG lane and run far more parallel. A
ratio quoted without its population is not comparable — which is the same defect
this module exists to prevent.

## Retention: how long must the series be kept?

**Two days demonstrably cannot answer the question, and neither can four.**

Derivation, not assertion. At the current rate the series accumulates ~15 distinct
main commits and **~4 conditioned points per 4.38 days ≈ 1 conditioned point per
day**. A median comparison across a change needs a usable sample on both sides;
at 20 points per side that is **~40 days of retention at today's conditioning
rate** — and the ledger is a local file with a 4.38-day history.

So retention has two independent requirements, and raising only one does not help:

- **Keep ≥ 90 days** of ledger rows, so a change three weeks old still has a
  before-side. Ninety days gives ~90 conditioned points at today's rate, enough
  for a seasonal baseline rather than a two-sample guess.
- **Raise the conditioning rate toward 100%.** Retention alone is useless if 85%
  of retained points are unconditioned; 90 days of unqualified walls is still a
  refusal. `concurrent_validates` must become mandatory on every row, not
  best-effort on 30%.

## Known gaps

- **Peak memory has no producer.** No `rss`/`mem`/`peak` key exists among the 51
  distinct keys observed across 691 rows. It is reported as `null` so the absence
  stays visible rather than being quietly dropped from the metric set.
- **Per-gate wall needed no producer** — contrary to the original task text,
  `gates[].real_seconds` is already present on 690/691 rows. This was a missing
  *view*, and that view now exists (`gates_top`).
- **Not wired to tick-hub.** The owner's phase-2 direction is that tick-hub calls
  this automatically so it stays measured. `--fail-over-budget` gives the exit
  code an alarm needs; nothing calls it yet.
- **No per-commit alarm at land time.** `compare()` is the primitive; binding it
  to "fires at the commit that caused it" requires the tick-hub wiring above.
