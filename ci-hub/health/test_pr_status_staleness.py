"""Can the drain report see STALENESS, and does it drain oldest-first?

WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner's correction (2026-08-04) is that an open-PR COUNT is
the wrong metric: "OLD PRs ARE ALWAYS A BREACH OF THE PROTOCOL. It is not just the
NUMBER of PRs, it is the STALENESS." A count treats a 3-hour-old PR and a
3-week-old PR as the same row. Worse, staleness compounds -- while a PR waits,
main advances, its head goes stale and its SHA-keyed validate receipt is
invalidated, so waiting does not merely delay a landing, it destroys the work that
made it landable.

Before this, `pr_status.py` did not fetch `createdAt` at all, carried no age
field, and emitted PRs in whatever order GitHub returned. So the report could not
rank by the thing that actually matters.

Bracketed BOTH directions, because an ordering test that only checks the happy
path passes on an unsorted list often enough to be useless:
  * POSITIVE -- a genuinely older PR must sort ahead of a newer one, and the age
    must be present and numerically right.
  * NEGATIVE -- a PR whose age is UNKNOWN must NOT sort first. `None` age must
    never masquerade as "oldest" and jump the drain queue, and must never be
    silently coerced to 0 (which would read as "brand new").
