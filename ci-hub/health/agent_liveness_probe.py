"""Independent, fail-closed liveness verdict for ONE named agent.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The standing mandate lets the coordinator replace a broken or
stuck agent "immediately and autonomously (close+respawn, no permission
needed)". That pairs an UNVERIFIED signal with an IRREVERSIBLE action. On
2026-08-08 health-tick reported a slot owner dead and a task ORPHANED with
`live_agents=6`, while `orc.listAgents()` showed 7 agents all busy and the
supposedly-dead `fleet-forensics` held the single most recent activity
timestamp on the box. Obeying the mandate literally would have destroyed a live
agent mid-P0.

An alarm is a TRIGGER TO CHECK, never a WARRANT TO ACT. This module is the
check, and it is deliberately built on a source INDEPENDENT of every gate that
can raise the alarm.

## The independent source

Every agent process carries `DG_AGENT_NAME` in its environment. Reading
`/proc/<pid>/environ` binds a LIVE PROCESS to an AGENT NAME without consulting
ORC, `ignored/ci-hub/agent-snapshot.json`, tick-hub, tmux, or the taskgraph.
The process either exists or it does not.

That independence is not cosmetic. Measured 2026-08-08: a `/proc` scan found
**29 distinct live agents while the snapshot health-tick reads listed 13** --
it was missing 16 of 29 (55%), because the snapshot is a cache of ONE orc
session's fleet and is structurally unable to see agents from another session.
Repairing its CONTENTS cannot fix that; only asking a different source can.

## Fail-closed, and specifically closed against its own breakage

DEAD is a POSITIVE observation of absence, and absence can only be claimed over
a scan whose coverage is known. So:

- Any live process for the name             -> ALIVE, refuse (rc 1).
- Zero matches, coverage complete, probe
  demonstrably working                      -> VERIFIED_DEAD, permit (rc 0).
- Anything else                             -> UNVERIFIABLE, refuse (rc 2).

"Anything else" includes the case that matters most: **if the scan cannot see
ANY agent at all, the probe cannot tell "this agent is dead" from "my detector
is broken", so it returns UNVERIFIABLE rather than 0.** Rename `DG_AGENT_NAME`,
run this in a container without host `/proc`, or break the environ read, and
this tool refuses every replacement instead of authorizing all of them. A
liveness check whose failure mode is "everyone looks dead" is worse than no
check at all when it is wired to a kill.

Blind spot is measured, not assumed: own-uid processes whose `environ` is
unreadable and which are not zombies (a zombie cannot be a running agent). On
2026-08-08 that was 5 of 1510 own-uid processes (0.3%). A nonzero blind spot
downgrades a would-be DEAD verdict to UNVERIFIABLE, because the agent could be
hiding in exactly the part we could not read.

THIS TOOL NEVER KILLS ANYTHING. It reads `/proc` and prints a verdict. It is
safe to run against any name at any time, which is what makes it usable as an
inert fixture in its own tests.
