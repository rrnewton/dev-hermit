"""Typed liveness for a held resource, and a fail-closed release verdict.

WHY. Measured 2026-08-07: `worktree-state.json` holds 96 slot records whose
fields are agents / allocated / *_branch / *_path / purpose / status / task /
updated (+ `coordinator_lease` on 5). There is **no pid, no heartbeat, no
last-seen** on any of them. So a recycled agent releases nothing, and a dead
owner's ACTIVE slot is indistinguishable from a live one.

`residue_sweep.py` copes by INFERRING death from two external signals — absence
from the live ORC fleet, and no same-user process cwd under the slot. That
inference is why it needs two signals and why it can only ever say "I cannot
find the owner", never "the owner is gone". This module makes the fact
queryable instead: if a record carries a lease, liveness is read directly; if
not, the two-signal inference is preserved but its result is typed UNKNOWN
rather than silently promoted to DEAD.

RELEASE IS FAIL-CLOSED, AND THAT IS NOT THEORETICAL. Of the 60 slots the sweep
flagged dead-owner, **21 hold uncommitted changes and 3 carry abandoned merge
conflicts** (measured same day). A reaper that acted on "owner not found" alone
would have destroyed work in a third of them. Hard Invariant 14: never remove a
dirty slot until its state has a documented recovery SHA. So every refusal
below is a measured hazard, not a hypothetical one.

Pure functions over already-collected facts: no subprocess, no filesystem, no
ORC call. The caller gathers evidence; this module only judges it.
