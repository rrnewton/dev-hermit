"""Standing check: parent commits that exist ONLY locally.

An unpushed commit emits no error, no failing check and no wakeup. On
2026-08-06 a local-main rewrite orphaned 45 of them; they were recovered only
because someone happened to run an fsck sweep. Three were noticed by their own
authors. The other 42 had nobody looking.

TWO DESIGN RULES, both learned that day:

1.  NEVER REPORT A BOOLEAN. ``scm: dirty`` was useless because it cannot
    distinguish 1 from 45. This prints the COUNT and the SUBJECTS.

2.  SCOPE TO ALL REFS, NOT HEAD. The obvious probe is
    ``rev-list --count HEAD --not --remotes``, but HEAD-scoped counting only
    sees the branch that happens to be checked out. Measured on this repo at
    the time of writing: HEAD-scoped said **1**, all-refs said **25**. Both are
    reported, and the all-refs number is the exposure.

Neither number covers commits that are unreachable from ANY ref -- that is what
the 45 were, and only ``git fsck --lost-found`` finds those. This check exists
to stop commits BECOMING unreachable, by publishing them while a ref still
points at them.

DETECT AND PUBLISH ONLY. This never merges, resets, rewrites, gcs, prunes,
expires a reflog, repacks or cleans. Its only mutation is creating new remote
refs under ``rescue/``, which cannot destroy anything.

OBSERVATION AND RESCUE ARE SEPARATE, AND THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING (2026-08-08).
Measured on this repo: the scan takes **0.40s**; a single ``herdr-run`` rescue
round-trip took **65.8s and 74.8s** (both failing, rc=69), and rescue makes TWO
per commit. Under the tick's 30s budget the gate had therefore NEVER emitted a
measurement -- not because it could not measure, but because ``main`` computed
the correct answer in 0.4s, then handed control to rescue, and printed only
afterwards. The timeout killed a process that was already holding a complete
result. **So the report is emitted BEFORE rescue is attempted.** A rescue that
hangs, fails, or is killed can no longer discard a measurement that succeeded.

Corollaries, each measured rather than assumed:

*   Cost does NOT scale with worktree count. 47 worktrees: ``rev-list --all``
    0.13s versus ``--single-worktree`` 0.12s. Narrowing scope would buy 10ms and
    lose the coverage that is the whole point -- head-scoped read 0 while
    all-refs read 1.
*   The rescue transport can be broken while egress is fine: the same ls-remote
    took 0.32s through ``with-proxy`` directly and timed out twice through
    ``herdr-run``. Rescue therefore bounds itself and reports what it skipped.

    A commit reachable from no remote ref is NOT the same fact as unpublished
    WORK. Rebase-then-force-update -- the normal landing path on this fleet --
    orphans the pre-rebase object every single time while its content lands
    perfectly well. This gate's first successful run flagged exactly one of
    those (`ef7cd9b`, whose change was already on main as `f37bd1c8`), and it
    was reported upward as a real catch before anyone checked it.

    A gate whose alarms are usually wrong is worse than no gate: it spends the
    attention a real alarm needs, and it will not be believed on the day it is
    right. The failure this gate exists for -- a 20-commit stack in zero origin
    refs -- is unrecoverable; the failure it produced here costs one check.
    Those are not symmetric, so BOTH tests below are biased toward reporting.

      1. `git cherry` -- patch-id equivalence. Survives rebase and reword, which
         plain blob comparison does not.
      2. Blob identity for every touched path, which catches a change that
         landed folded into some other commit, where no patch id matches.

    Anything else stays `unpublished` and still pages. A conflict resolved
    during a rebase changes the patch and can defeat both tests; that direction
    is deliberate -- it re-reports a superseded commit rather than silencing a
    real one.
