"""Reconcile `rescue/auto-*` refs against main and report only real losses.

`ci-hub/health/unpushed_parent_commits.py --rescue` pushes every local-only
parent commit to its own `rescue/auto-<short>` ref. That side already works:
on 2026-08-06 a plain `git reset HEAD~1` on shared parent main dropped another
agent's commit as collateral, and `origin/rescue/auto-29e2cf7` is why the work
still existed. What was missing is the OTHER side -- nothing ever compared
those refs back against `main`, so a dropped commit was silent for ~20 minutes
and was noticed only by luck.

WHY THIS CLASSIFIES INSTEAD OF JUST TESTING ANCESTRY. Measured over all 109
rescue refs on 2026-08-07: 78 are ancestors of origin/main and 31 are not. Of
those 31, 12 have their subject already on main -- the work was recovered by
RE-COMMITTING it under a new SHA, so the old SHA is orphaned but nothing was
lost. Several more are git-stash artifacts or merges. A pure-ancestry alarm
would therefore have opened with 31 findings of which most are noise, and an
alarm that noisy gets muted -- at which point the one real loss is invisible
again, which is the failure this tool exists to prevent.

Precedence matters: a commit is checked LANDED -> NOT-A-LOSS -> RECOVERED ->
UNRECONCILED, and only UNRECONCILED is reported. Counts for every class are
always printed so the denominator travels with the finding.

What each verdict actually proves, stated plainly because they are not equal:

  LANDED       proof. Ancestry on a freshly-fetched main is the real thing.
  NOT-A-LOSS   proof for stashes (a stash commit was never on a branch) and for
               a merge whose parents are all on main (its content is its
               parents'). Not a judgement call.
  RECOVERED    EVIDENCE, NOT PROOF. A matching patch-id is strong; a matching
               subject alone is weak -- two commits can share a subject and
               differ in content. Subject-only matches are marked so a reader
               can tell them apart rather than trusting the label.
  UNRECONCILED "none of the above", i.e. worth a human look. Not a claim that
               the commit is definitely lost.
