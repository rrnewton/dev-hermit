"""Bracket the unpushed-parent-commits gate's RUNTIME and its SCOPE.

On 2026-08-08 this gate surfaced as ``ERROR: gate command could not run ...
timed out after 30s`` while a real unpushed stack existed on the box. The
reporting was CORRECT -- could-not-measure, not a clean pass -- and the tests
below exist to keep it that way while pinning down what actually costs time.

Two properties are asserted, because the incident turned on both:

1.  COST IS PER LOCAL-ONLY COMMIT, NOT PER WORKTREE. ``--scope all`` means "all
    REFS of the parent repo", not "all worktrees on the box". Detection is a
    single ``rev-list``; it is ``--rescue`` that spends two network round trips
    PER COMMIT FOUND. That gives the gate a vicious shape: it is instant when
    there is nothing to find and only becomes expensive once it finds
    something, so its timeout is anti-correlated with the risk it exists to
    cover. ``test_runtime_scales_with_commit_count`` measures that directly.

2.  SILENCE IS NOT COVERAGE. Every git call in the gate runs with ``cwd=PARENT``,
    so a commit living only in a product worktree is invisible to it no matter
    how long it is allowed to run. ``test_scope_all_does_not_see_a_nested_repo``
    pins that as a known, deliberate boundary rather than an assumed one.

The fixtures are fully inert: a local bare repo stands in for ``origin`` and a
stub replaces ``herdr-run``, so nothing here touches the network, the real
parent checkout, or any live tmux pane.
