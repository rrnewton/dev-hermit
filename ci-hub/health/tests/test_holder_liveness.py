"""Both-direction brackets for holder liveness and fail-closed release.

A reaper that never releases is useless; one that always releases destroys
work. So every refusal here is paired with a case proving the same clause can
permit a release.

The refusals are sized on measured reality, not imagination: of the 60 slots
the residue sweep flagged dead-owner on 2026-08-07, 21 held uncommitted changes
and 3 carried abandoned merge conflicts.
