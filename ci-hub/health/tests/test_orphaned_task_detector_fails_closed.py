"""`scripts/orphaned-task-detector.sh` must refuse an unreadable task graph.

The regression these lock: run bare, the detector used to read `tg`'s implicit
empty `tasks` default and print "scanned 0 ... ORPHANED: 0" at exit 0 — the same
verdict word and the same exit code as a full census that found nothing. A
detector that reports health because it could not see anything is worse than one
that does not run.

The database guard deliberately runs BEFORE the live-fleet read, so these cases
are exercisable without an orc socket: the refusal is decided before anything
report-shaped is printed.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, because a stub in a test is exactly the thing that deserves
    justification. These four cases test the DATABASE guard. That guard sits
    behind a tool-presence guard for three tools this repository's agents always
    have and hosted CI never does — `tg` is a large fbsource binary absent from
    ubuntu-latest by construction. So on CI the detector exited 3 at line 93 and
    the cases never reached their own subject: they were red for a reason
    unrelated to the property they assert.

    The stub is inert and cannot fake a measurement. The database guard resolves
    through `ci-hub/lib/taskgraph_db.py` and returns before any of these three is
    ever INVOKED, so what the stub does is irrelevant — only that it exists.
    Nothing here weakens an assertion; it supplies a precondition so the
    assertion can run at all. The tool-presence guard keeps its own coverage in
    `test_a_missing_tool_is_could_not_measure_not_zero_orphans` below, which
