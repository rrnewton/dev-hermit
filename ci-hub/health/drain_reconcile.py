"""Detect open PRs that no landing tracker is accounting for.

WHY THIS IS THE FIRST THING BUILT, not the last. Filing a PR is the moment work
enters the implemented-but-not-landed state, so filing is the event that must
extend the landing tracker. Two mechanisms can enforce that coupling -- a
wrapper script around PR creation, or a git hook -- and BOTH ARE BYPASSABLE. An
agent can call ``gh pr create`` directly; ``.git/hooks`` is per-clone and
un-versioned, so a fresh clone silently has none. A prevention with no detector
is indistinguishable from a working one. This is the detector, and it is also
the only mechanism that says anything about PRs filed BEFORE the coupling
existed.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO CATCH IS LIVE. At the time of writing, coverage was
0 of 133 open PRs across four repositories: the tracker's newest reference was
``hermit#1840`` while open PRs ran to ``#1876``. The reference ranges OVERLAP
(tracker 1120..1840, open 1665..1876), so the empty intersection is a real gap
and not an artifact of comparing disjoint eras.

DESIGN CONSTRAINT LEARNED FROM THAT MEASUREMENT. A reconciler that emitted one
finding per unrepresented PR would have emitted 133 on its first run and been
switched off the same day. So a STRUCTURAL fault -- the tracker missing, or
closed, or unparseable -- is reported as ONE finding that explains why coverage
is zero, and the per-PR list is suppressed behind ``--list-gaps``. Per-PR
findings are for the steady state, where they are few and each is actionable.

LOUDNESS DISCIPLINE, inherited from ``pr_status.py`` for the same reason: no
output plus a zero exit is indistinguishable from "everything is tracked". A
query that fails or is blocked is ALWAYS reported as UNAVAILABLE with a reason
and a non-zero exit, never as an empty-but-green report.

Exit codes:
  0  every open PR is represented, and the tracker is healthy
  1  gaps found (tracker healthy, but some open PRs are unrepresented)
  2  UNAVAILABLE -- a required authority could not be read, so the answer is
     unknown. NEVER conflated with 0.
  3  STRUCTURAL -- the tracker itself is missing or terminal, so coverage is
     meaningless rather than zero.
