"""Selection and persistence policy for the recurring `Periodic showcase`.

The owner wants a periodic showcase of what NEWLY works, not manufactured
novelty. That makes selection the whole problem, and selection is a pure
function of two things -- the compat scorecard history and what was shown last
time -- so it lives here, in a plain script with real tests, rather than inside
an ORC workflow body that can only be exercised by running the fleet.

The workflow (.orc/plugins/periodic-showcase/index.ts) is deliberately thin:
poll `select`, and if it reports a delta, wake the coordinator with the
instruction this script generated, then call `record-shown`. Everything a test
would want to assert is therefore reachable without ORC, without a coordinator,
and without sending a message to anybody.

    select        decide whether a showcase is due; print the instruction
    record-shown  persist what was actually shown, so it is not repeated
    state         print the persisted state

Exit codes are the interface the workflow branches on:
    0  a showcase is due; stdout is the coordinator instruction
    1  nothing newly works -- report that plainly, do NOT fabricate a demo
    2  no usable scorecard history (cannot decide; not the same as "nothing new")
    3  usage or internal error
