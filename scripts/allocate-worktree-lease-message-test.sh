# Bracketed (Proxy-Binding) test for the OWNER-LEASE REFUSAL WORDING in
# scripts/allocate-worktree.rs::observe_owner_lease.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST IS THE MESSAGE, NOT THE POLICY. The lease must keep failing
# closed in exactly the cases it failed closed before; only the text that
# explains WHY is split by cause. So every case below asserts BOTH halves:
#
#   (a) the message names the correct cause, and
#   (b) the lease is still UNBOUND in worktree-state.json.
#
# (b) is the guard that matters. A rewording that accidentally admitted would
# still print nice text, so the wording assertions alone would pass a broken
# gate. Binding is the observable that proves the refusal fired.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: on 2026-08-08 a snapshot that was 52s old but held only
# {name:"worker", tmux_pane_id:null} made every real agent resolve zero times.
# The single message "owner snapshot resolves agent X 0 times" was read as
# "X is not a real agent". Four slots were recorded permanently lease-less,
# adoption was re-run against a remedy that could not work, and one
# release-then-reallocate left the validate-rust slot in a collision state.
#
#   IMPLAUSIBLE (stub / empty / dead panes) -> the message must accuse the SNAPSHOT
#   PLAUSIBLE  (real fleet, agent not in it) -> the message must accuse the AGENT
#   PLAUSIBLE  (agent listed twice)          -> the message must say AMBIGUOUS
#   PLAUSIBLE  (agent present on a live pane)-> the lease must BIND (admit control)
#
# The last case is not decoration: without it this suite would pass on a build
# that refuses unconditionally.
#
# Runs entirely in a temp fixture root. It NEVER writes the live
# ignored/ci-hub/agent-snapshot.json and never touches the live registry. It
# does READ this box's real tmux pane list, because "is this pane real" is the
# predicate under test and a fabricated pane id cannot exercise it.
