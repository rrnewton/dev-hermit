#
# THIS CHECK USED TO ASSERT THE OPPOSITE. It held a hardcoded four-file list and
# REQUIRED each to contain a literal `liteinst-runtime-<8hex>` equal to the pin.
# Those literals were removed when the suffix moved into the staging script, so
# the check reported `cache keys=none` on all four and blocked the snapshot --
# against a tree that was correct. Worse, the obvious way to "fix" the red was to
# paste the literals back, which would have PASSED the check and REINTRODUCED the
# drift it exists to prevent. A green over hardcoded values is worse than a red.

    WHY THERE IS A THIRD OUTCOME. This function used to answer "did it publish?"
    with yes/no, and every no was a HARD WARNING. But most nos are not defects,
    they are races: thirteen agents push parent main, so the reference this
    snapshot must sit on top of moves while the snapshot is being prepared.
    Measured 2026-08-08, parent main advanced five times in about twenty minutes
    (fde6376f -> 82a4c328 -> a6d0ed99 -> 08ce5ca0 -> 119aa11b -> a20ca763). An
    agent dispatched to "make the gate stop firing" is chasing a target that
    moves faster than it can be caught, and one nearly looped forever doing it.

    WHAT THE REFUSAL ACTUALLY PROTECTS, which is the thing to bind to. The hazard
    is committing this gitlink snapshot onto a STALE parent base: published, that
    is either rejected non-fast-forward or, reconciled carelessly, reverts
    everything landed between the stale base and the tip. This repository has
    already lost 45 commits exactly that way, so the hazard is real.

    IT IS ALREADY PREVENTED ONE LAYER DOWN, ATOMICALLY. `scripts/parent-main-write`
    takes an exclusive lock, fetches origin/main, requires local main to equal the
    fetched value, commits, pushes under CAS and verifies ancestry. The currency
    precheck here was a SECOND, WEAKER COPY of that check run OUTSIDE the lock --
    which is precisely why it raced when the real one does not. AGENTS.md is
    explicit: one verifier per authority, called by every consumer. So currency is
    no longer pre-judged here; `parent-main-write` remains its single verifier and
    a lost race is reported as DEFERRED.

    WHAT STAYS AN IMMEDIATE HARD WARNING: incoherence that no amount of retrying
    fixes -- a dirty primary, a primary off main, a primary not at its own
    origin/main, or an inconsistent Reverie pin. Those are not moving references.

    Unlike ``check`` (which also inspects primary-checkout freshness, parent
    gitlinks, and queries the network), this verifies only that the Reverie
    *pin* is internally consistent across the Hermit checkout: every tracked
    Cargo.toml rev is identical, and every tracked Cargo.lock source (including
    the nested liteinst-runtime-build/Cargo.lock) references that same SHA.

    It performs NO network access and does NOT look at primary freshness or
    parent gitlinks, so it never blocks a commit that merely repairs a stale
    gitlink; it blocks only a *silent pin drift* where one Reverie reference
    was moved without the others. That makes it safe to run in a pre-commit
    hook. Two dimensions are deliberately EXCLUDED from this blocking gate and
    left to the warning-only ``check``:
      * currency (is the pin on reverie main?) -- networked; also enforced by
        hermit's own check-reverie-pin.rs hook + CI;
        * the LiteInst build-cache key -- it is DERIVED at run time by
          scripts/stage-liteinst-runtime.sh from the canonical pin, so there
          is no stored literal to compare and nothing here can drift. What
          is checked instead is that the derivation still exists and that no
          file hardcodes a suffix (reverie_cache_derivation_errors).

    WHAT IT READS (changed 2026-08-06 after a fleet-wide false block): the
    Hermit tree at the gitlink this parent commit will RECORD, never the Hermit
    working tree. A parent commit records a submodule *commit*, so the recorded
    commit is the only pin state it can possibly introduce; another agent's
    in-flight edits under hermit/ are not part of it and must not block an
    unrelated parent commit. Hermit's own pre-commit hook and CI guard the
    Hermit working tree, and the warning-only ``check`` still reports it.

    FAILURE POSTURE. Fail-CLOSED on real drift: the recorded tree is readable
    and its Reverie references disagree -> exit 1. Fail-OPEN, loudly, when the
    gate cannot be evaluated at all (no gitlink, or the recorded commit is
    absent from the local object store) -- an unevaluable gate is not evidence
    of drift, and blocking there is what turned a stale premise into an outage.
