# Durable driver for the dev-hermit operational health tick.
#
# ROOT CAUSE this replaces: the operational-health poll was previously driven by
# an ORC-session-bound wf.loop (operationalHealthHeartbeat in
# .orc/plugins/hermit-dev/index.ts). Session-runtime state is NOT a durable
# schedule: when the hosting coordinator session was recycled (~2026-08-03
# 08:53 PDT) the loop stopped and the replacement session restored only the
# stale reminder-only hermit-dev-pr-health spec, which never calls health-tick.
# fired-state froze for ~38h and the silence looked exactly like health.
#
# This script is invoked by a systemd --user timer (Linger=yes) so it survives
# logout, reboot, and session recycling.

# $HOME, not a literal: this file is version-controlled and the parent's
# portability gate rejects owner-specific paths. A shell DOES expand $HOME
# (unlike a systemd unit, which needs %h).
