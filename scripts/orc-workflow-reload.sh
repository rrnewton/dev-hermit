#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Bounded, versioned reload of a single ORC workflow.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A workflow holds the module snapshot the engine evaluated when
# it was registered, so editing a plugin on disk does nothing until the workflow
# re-evaluates. The only routes to that were an owner-only Orc relaunch, or
# injecting arbitrary JS into the live coordinator to call orc.killWorkflow --
# against workflows whose crash-loop is a known, load-bearing failure mode. This
# uses the engine's own `/api/workflow/restart` endpoint instead: one named
# operation over the authenticated socket, no arbitrary code execution.
#
# WHY IT CANNOT CRASH-LOOP. The engine re-evaluates the module on restart, and a
# module that throws takes the workflow down, restarts, throws again -- until the
# engine exhausts its restart budget and the heartbeat is silently dead. Both
# workflows in the hermit-dev plugin died exactly that way. So this script
# REFUSES TO RESTART ANYTHING until every --preflight command exits 0. A plugin
# that does not parse, or whose tests fail, never reaches the engine. That is the
# bound: the dangerous operation is gated behind evidence, not attempted and
# then repaired.
#
# It then VERIFIES rather than assumes: the active source identity must actually
# change, the workflow must come back alive, exactly one instance of the name
# must exist (no duplicate), and the state must be stable across several samples
# (no flapping). Any of those failing is a nonzero exit with a typed reason.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/orc-workflow-reload.sh --session <id-or-prefix> --workflow <name>
#       [--preflight 'cmd']...     Gate: all must exit 0 before any restart.
#       [--expect-marker STR]...   Must be ABSENT before and PRESENT after.
#       [--settle-secs N]          Stability window after restart (default 30).
#       [--dry-run]                Report the before-state and preflight only.
#       [--method restart|reload-config]
#
# METHOD MATTERS, AND restart IS NOT ENOUGH. Measured 2026-08-07:
# /api/workflow/restart returns {"sent":true} and creates a new run attempt, but
# the active source identity is BYTE-IDENTICAL afterwards -- it replays the spec
# stored at registration rather than re-evaluating the module from disk. So a
# plugin edit is invisible to it. `reload-config` invokes the engine's own
# documented `reloadConfig` ("Hot-reload config.js"), which re-imports config.js
# and re-registers the workflows with the new source. Both are NAMED engine
# operations over the authenticated socket; neither injects arbitrary JS.
# Default is reload-config because it is the one that actually changes identity.
