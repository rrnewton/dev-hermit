# orphaned-task-detector.sh — REPORT-ONLY detector for taskgraph work that lost
# its owner to an agent recycle.
#
# THE DEFECT (task work-orphaned-by-agent-recycle-has-no-detector): an agent
# claims a tg task (status IN_PROGRESS, owner=<agent>), then recycles ~every
# 30-60 min. The task row survives with its owner string intact; the AGENT does
# not. Nothing detects this: an orphaned IN_PROGRESS task emits no wakeup, no
# failure, no queue entry — the wakeup system only surfaces READY tasks, so an
# owned-but-dead IN_PROGRESS task is invisible BY CONSTRUCTION. The absence of
# an owner emits no signal, exactly like a worktree slot held by a dead agent
# (see scripts/worktree-gc.sh orphan-candidate column). ONE root cause, two
# surfaces: NO LIVENESS SIGNAL TIES A RESOURCE TO A LIVE OWNER.
#
# WHY THIS SURFACE IS EXACT (and the slot surface was not):
#   tg has an explicit `owner` column AND the live fleet is directly
#   enumerable — every live agent is a tmux window on orc's isolated socket.
#   So "owner no longer exists" is an EXACT set-membership test, not a proxy.
#   The worktree-gc orphan column had to fall back to an idle-hours (source
#   mtime) heuristic precisely because worktree-state.json has no owner field
#   and no liveness link; there, an agent mid-thought looks idle and the signal
#   is ambiguous. HERE there is no idle-vs-dead ambiguity: a task owned by a
#   name that is NOT a live window is unambiguously orphaned, regardless of age.
#   => NO time threshold N is needed or used. Age is printed for triage only.
#   (Recycle cadence ~30-60 min is context, not a gate; deriving N would only
#   matter if we lacked the exact owner-existence check, which we do not.)
#
# REPORT ONLY — SAME SHAPE AS THE GC ORPHAN COLUMN. This tool NEVER reassigns,
# closes, or edits a task. It cross-references and prints. The coordinator
# decides routing (an orphan must become a task-with-an-owner OR an explicit
# close — never a silent third state). Reassignment is a human/coordinator call.
#
# LIVE FLEET SOURCE (the running thing, not a config — see CLAUDE.md "Verify A
# Mechanism By The Running Thing"): the actual tmux windows orc is running, read
# off orc's isolated socket. We collect window names across ALL sessions on that
# socket, so an agent living in any orc session counts as alive (conservative:
# over-counting alive => FEWER false orphans, never more).
#
# FAIL-SAFE: if the live fleet cannot be determined (socket missing, tmux fails,
# zero windows found) the tool ABORTS with exit 3 and flags NOTHING. It must
# never mass-flag every task as orphaned on a fleet-read failure — that is the
# same fail-safe posture as affected-test-selection -> FULL.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/orphaned-task-detector.sh              # report orphaned IN_PROGRESS tasks
#   scripts/orphaned-task-detector.sh --all-status # also scan OPEN/BACKLOG owned tasks
#   scripts/orphaned-task-detector.sh --gate       # same report; exit 1 iff orphans found
#
# --gate changes ONLY the exit code, never the output: it lets a composite health
# poll (`ci-hub health`) go non-green when a real orphan exists, so orphans
# surface on EVERY poll instead of a one-off audit. The default (no --gate)
# keeps the report-only contract: exit 0 whether or not orphans exist. In BOTH
# modes a fail-safe fleet-read abort is exit 3 and flags nothing.
#
# TWO INPUTS, BOTH FAIL CLOSED. The report is a cross-reference of the live
# fleet against the task graph, so it is only meaningful when BOTH were read.
# The fleet side has always aborted rather than mass-flag (exit 3). The task-graph
# side used to fail OPEN: `tg` with no database bound reads an empty `tasks`
# default and returns 0 rows, so a bare run printed "scanned 0 ... ORPHANED: 0"
# at exit 0 — byte-identical in verdict and exit code to a full census that found
# nothing. Measured 2026-08-08: bound = "scanned 17 ... ORPHANED: 0" rc=0,
# unbound = "scanned 0 ... ORPHANED: 0" rc=0. Silence read as health.
# The database is now resolved through the single authority
# ci-hub/lib/taskgraph_db.py and an unresolvable one is exit 2, never a clean
# report. A BOUND database with genuinely zero owned non-terminal tasks stays a
# MEASURED clean 0 — the resolver validates the database's SHAPE, never its
# contents, precisely so empty stays distinguishable from unreadable.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  = ran; default mode (orphans may or may not exist, see report), or
#        --gate mode with ZERO orphans.
#   1  = --gate mode ONLY: ran and found >=1 orphan (actionable).
#   2  = could not read the task graph (nothing scanned; fail-closed).
#   3  = could not determine the live fleet (nothing flagged; fail-safe).
#   64 = usage error.
