#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Every failure of parent-main-write must SAY WHY, by inducing the failure --
# not by reading the source.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. `scripts/parent-main-write` runs under
# `set -euo pipefail`. Its reversion guard builds the refusal message with
#
#     report+=$( { diff ... || true; } | sed -n 's/^> /      LOST: /p' | head -6 )
#
# `head -6` closes the pipe after six lines, `sed` dies of SIGPIPE, `pipefail`
# makes the substitution exit 141, and `set -e` aborts the script -- WHILE IT IS
# BUILDING THE VERY MESSAGE THAT EXPLAINS THE REFUSAL. The author guarded
# `diff`'s exit-1 with `|| true` and the comment above it says so; the `head`
# SIGPIPE was not guarded. Measured directly: the shape exits 141 after printing
# nothing.
#
# So the most safety-critical refusal in the file -- "this publish would drop
# content that landed on main after X" -- was the one that went silent, and only
# when there was a lot to say. Agents saw an attempt that did not work, with no
# explanation, and re-derived the cause by hand. Several did, today.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED. Each induced failure must produce a DISTINCT and ACCURATE
# message naming its own cause, and a successful publish must be unaffected.
# Distinctness is checked, not just non-emptiness: four failures that all say
# "refused" would satisfy a weaker test while leaving the reader exactly as
# stranded as silence did.
#
# Fully inert: a temp repo with a local bare origin. Never touches the real
# parent, the real lock, or the network.
