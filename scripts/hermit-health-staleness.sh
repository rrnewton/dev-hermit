# EXTERNAL staleness alarm for the dev-hermit operational health tick.
#
# Design invariant: this alarm deliberately does NOT depend on any tick-hub code
# (self-reference trap — a monitor that shares fate with the thing it monitors
# fails silently together). It only stat()s two files. If the heartbeat is
# older than N tick intervals, THAT is the alert. Without this, the next
# silence is as invisible as the 38h gap that motivated it.
#
# WHAT WAKES THIS ALARM (the recursive question): an INDEPENDENT trigger —
# hermit-health-staleness.timer (systemd --user, OnUnitActiveSec=10min), which
# re-arms off its OWN last activation, NOT off the tick service. A stopped
# tick-hub therefore does NOT stop this watchdog; they do not share fate at the
# application layer. The only common substrate is the systemd --user manager
# itself (Linger=yes survives reboot, Persistent=true catches up missed runs).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TWO FILES, TWO FACTS. Watching the wrong one makes the alarm useless.
#
#   HEARTBEAT  = ~/.local/state/hermit-health-tick-invocations.log
#       Appended on EVERY tick by hermit-health-tick.sh, regardless of the
#       tick's rc. This is the "is the monitor ALIVE / did the timer FIRE"
#       signal. It going FLAT is the exact 38h-silence failure mode. THIS is
#       the file whose staleness must page loudly.
#
#   PRODUCTIVE = ~/work/dev-hermit/.tick-hub/fired-state
#       mtime bumps ONLY on a productive rc=0 tick. It freezes for a LEGITIMATE
#       external reason (agent-utils pin drift gates health-tick to rc=1) while
#       the monitor is perfectly alive. Paging on THIS alone screams forever
#       and gets muted — as useless as never firing. So a frozen PRODUCTIVE
#       signal, when the HEARTBEAT is fresh, is classified, named, and (for the
#       known pin-drift gate) NOT paged as a dead timer.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS ALARM CANNOT SEE (stated plainly, not left implied).
#   This alarm verifies TWO things only, both by file mtime: (1) that the timer
#   FIRED (heartbeat freshness = liveness) and (2) that a tick did PRODUCTIVE
#   work (fired-state freshness). It does NOT verify that a firing tick's
#   INTERNAL health checks actually RAN and MEANT anything. A tick that fires on
#   schedule and returns rc=0 while its checks silently no-op — accepted,
#   running, verifying nothing (the `--cgroups` shape) — would advance BOTH
#   signals and read here as HEALTHY. Closing that gap requires the tick to emit
#   a POSITIVE, counted receipt (e.g. "polled main @SHA, N checks executed") and
#   this alarm to assert on that count, not merely on freshness. Until then:
#   this alarm proves the monitor is ALIVE, NOT that it is doing correct work.

# perfectly. That divergence produced a false "TIMER DEAD" at 02:54:14Z claiming
# 960s when the true last-invocation age was 206s.
# So mtime answers "a tick last FINISHED", not "the timer is firing", and only
