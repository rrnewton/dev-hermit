"""Derive worktree-slot liveness from the RUNNING SYSTEM, not from an assertion.

`worktree-state.json` records who *claimed* a slot. It has never recorded whether
that claimant still exists, so a dead owner's `status=active` slot is
indistinguishable from a live one and stays protected forever while its contents
rot invisibly. Measured 2026-08-07: 104 slots marked `active` against a policy cap
of 12 active worktrees / 15 agents, and a teardown left 14 commits existing in
exactly one place plus 30 dirty trees with nothing signalling it.

THE DESIGN CHOICE THAT MATTERS. The obvious fix -- add a `heartbeat` field agents
must write -- reproduces the defect it is meant to cure: a registry that agents
must REMEMBER to update goes stale, and a stale heartbeat is indistinguishable
from a dead one. So liveness here is DERIVED, not declared:

    a slot is LIVE iff the operating system says a live process is in it.

Nobody can forget to update that, and nobody can forge it by editing a file. The
recorded `owner_pid`/`heartbeat` fields (written by `touch`) are corroborating
evidence only -- they can promote a slot to LIVE, never demote one to DEAD.

Three independent authorities are reconciled, and they are NOT collapsed into one
check, because each fails differently:

  1. REGISTRY   -- worktree-state.json (what was claimed)
  2. PORCELAIN  -- `git worktree list --porcelain` (what git believes)
  3. PROCESSES  -- /proc/<pid>/cwd (what is actually happening)

A slot present in 2 or 3 but absent from 1 is a BARE-GIT BYPASS: someone ran
`git worktree add` directly, and the registry now looks complete while being wrong.
That is worse than no registry, so it is reported as its own class.

READ-ONLY by default. `report` never writes, never removes, never cleans; 30 slots
currently hold unprotected uncommitted work and reclaiming is explicitly not this
tool's job. Only `touch` writes, and only the two liveness fields of one slot.
