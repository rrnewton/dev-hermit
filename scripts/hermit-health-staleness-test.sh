# Fixture tests for the external health-timer staleness alarm.
#
# THE DEFECT THESE PIN. On 2026-08-07T02:54:14Z the alarm paged
# "TIMER DEAD -- no tick observed in 16min" while the durable invocation log
# showed a successful tick 206s earlier. The alarm was neither delayed nor
# mis-delivered; it read a signal that LAGS. hermit-health-tick.sh stamps its
# log line at tick START but appends it at tick END, so the invocation log's
# MTIME marks when a tick last COMPLETED. Measured live on this box: a tick
# started 03:25:58Z and completed 03:27:23Z -- an 85s append lag with the
# service running throughout. While a tick is in flight the mtime necessarily
# ages, so mtime alone cannot tell a DEAD timer from a SLOW tick.
#
# Every case below runs the REAL script against hermetic fixtures via its
# env-override hooks; nothing touches live state, and no alert is ever pushed.
