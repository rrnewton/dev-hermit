"""One writer per results ledger — and a DEAD writer must never block a live one.

WHY
---
The corpus runners append to a shared `results.tsv` and dedupe with
`grep -q "^$label\\t" results.tsv && continue`. Two drivers against one ledger
corrupt it in a way that leaves no trace:

  * TOCTOU on the dedupe. Both greps miss the same label, both measure it, both
    append. The file still parses, every row is well-formed, and
    `wc -l - 1` now OVERSTATES coverage. A `133/171` derived from it is wrong
    with no symptom.
  * Two verdicts for one guest, possibly disagreeing. Whichever a reader hits
    first wins, and which that is depends on append order.

That is worse than a crash: a crash stops and says so; this publishes.

Observed 2026-08-07: `ignored/w7-corpus-run/results.tsv` is written by
`runner/runner.sh`, `runner/batch.sh`, and `runner/wait_then_batch.sh`, and a
FOURTH driver (`scratch/w27-corpus-fix/wait_then_batch.fixed.sh`, a different
agent) appends to the same file. None of the four takes any lock.

THE MECHANISM, AND WHY IT IS flock AND NOT A PID FILE
------------------------------------------------------
A PID/heartbeat file has to answer "is the owner still alive?", and getting that
wrong in the safe direction produces a guard that cannot be released when its
owner dies. That is the trap `ci-hub validate-lock` is in: an owner proven dead,
a quarantine that `reclaim-dead` refuses by design, and every agent's run
refused until a human intervenes. Do not build a second one.

`flock(2)` has no such state. The lock lives on the OPEN FILE DESCRIPTION, so the
kernel drops it when the holder exits, is killed -9, segfaults, or has its
terminal torn away. There is nothing to time out, nothing to reclaim, and no
stale PID can hold it: a dead owner is indistinguishable from an owner that
never existed. The dead-owner trap is not mitigated here, it is unrepresentable.

The guard therefore `exec`s the driver while holding the fd, so the lock's
lifetime is exactly the driver's lifetime.

The PID/start-time/boot-id sidecar this writes is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY -- it exists so
a human can see who holds the lock. It is never consulted to decide whether to
refuse. Keeping it strictly non-authoritative is what stops it growing into the
thing it replaced.

USAGE
-----
    scripts/single-driver.py run --ledger PATH [--name NAME] -- CMD [ARG...]
    scripts/single-driver.py status --ledger PATH
    scripts/single-driver.py check  --ledger PATH     # exit 0 free, 3 held

EXIT
----
0  the driver ran (its own status is propagated)
3  REFUSED: another driver holds the ledger
4  the lock file cannot be created, or the filesystem cannot flock
2  usage
