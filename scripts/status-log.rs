const USAGE: &str = r#"Usage: scripts/status-log.rs [OPTIONS]

EVERY COUNT CARRIES ITS DENOMINATOR. Two adjacent entries once recorded
open_prs=105 and open_prs=10 nineteen minutes apart because one counted total
open across repositories and the other counted a ready/non-draft subset. The
same field name made a denominator change look like a 10x real drop. A count
whose counted set is not recorded beside it is not a measurement, so --repos is
required and `open_prs` has exactly one permitted meaning.

THE MAPPING IS AN ACTIVITY REPORT, NOT AN OWNERSHIP LEDGER. The 2026-08-07T01:00
entry listed 19 workstreams for 7 agents -- hermit-w3 seven times -- and not one
of the 19 was active work: 16 were tagged `implemented` (one already closed) and
3 were still OPEN/BACKLOG. Every task a name still owns is not every task it is
doing, so --mapping-json carries exactly ONE genuinely in-flight task per agent,
each task is dereferenced against live TaskGraph rather than believed, and work
that is implemented-awaiting-landing goes in --awaiting-landing-json where it
stays visible without being counted as activity.

Required:
  --mapping-json JSON    ACTIVE work only. Object mapping each workstream slug
                         to {"agent":"NAME","task":"TASK-ID","cwd":"PATH"}.
                         At most one entry per agent. Slugs are stable
                         descriptive major-goal/sub-goal, e.g.
                         backend-parity/dbi-stack-hash-determinism.
  --repos LIST           Comma-separated owner/name repositories that every
                         count below was taken over, e.g.
                         rrnewton/hermit,rrnewton/reverie. This is the
                         denominator; it is recorded with the counts.
  --open-prs N           TOTAL open PRs INCLUDING DRAFTS across --repos.
                         This is the only permitted meaning of `open_prs`.
  --genuine-reds N       Current number of genuine-red PRs.
  --fleet-count N        Current active fleet size.

Status input:
  --status-file PATH     Read the full status text from PATH.
                         When omitted, read the full text from stdin.
                         EITHER WAY at most one trailing line terminator is
                         stripped, so a heredoc, an editor and a pipe all yield
                         the SAME canonical bytes. A status logged from a file
                         once carried one extra 0x0A that the sent message did
                         not, which made a correct delivery hash as tampered.
  --expect-sha256 HEX    Assert the canonical status text hashes to HEX, which
                         is what the GChat API reported for the sent message.
                         A mismatch REFUSES the append instead of recording a
                         status that is not the one delivered.
  --expect-bytes N       Assert the canonical status text is N bytes, the byte
                         count the API reported. Refuses on mismatch.

Other:
  --awaiting-landing-json JSON
                         OPTIONAL, and a DISTINCT field. Same shape as
                         --mapping-json, for tasks tagged `implemented` that
                         are waiting to land. Recorded as
                         `awaiting_landing_to_worker`; never counted as active
                         work. Its tasks MUST be implemented-awaiting-landing,
                         which is the mirror image of the active check.
  --task-states-json PATH
                         Read task states from a JSON file instead of querying
                         TaskGraph: {"task-id":{"status":"IN_PROGRESS",
                         "tags":["implemented"]}}. For tests and offline use.
  --ready-prs N          OPTIONAL, and a DISTINCT field. The ready/non-draft
                         subset. Recorded as `ready_prs`, never as `open_prs`.
  --open-prs-basis B     Assert the basis of --open-prs. The only accepted
                         value is total-open-including-drafts (the default).
                         A ready/non-draft basis is REFUSED here: pass it as
                         --ready-prs instead.
  --describe-log [PATH]  Read the log and print one line per entry describing
                         each entry's count denominator, then exit. Entries
                         written before schema 2 are labelled
                         denominator=unknown. Read-only: never rewrites.
  --log-file PATH        Override the repository-relative log path.
                         Default: ai_docs/status-log/status-log.jsonl
  -h, --help             Show this help.

/// 1843 bytes / sha256 `fd702682…`; the JSONL entry for the same status recorded
/// 1844 bytes / `1ccab376…`. The difference was exactly one appended `0x0A` in
/// the 1843-byte common prefix — zero differing bytes otherwise. The extra byte
/// came from the `--status-file` round trip, because every ordinary way of
/// producing a text file (an editor, a heredoc, `echo`, a shell redirect)
/// terminates the last line. The sent message had no such byte.
///
/// That one byte is not cosmetic. The claim's digest then hashes the LOGGED text
/// while `gchat_message_name` dereferences the SENT text, so an auditor who
/// fetches the message and hashes what comes back gets a MISMATCH on a correct
/// delivery — the record accuses itself of tampering.
///
/// It was also inconsistent, which is worse than uniformly wrong: entries at
/// 01:00:36Z and 02:28:13Z (stdin) carried no trailing newline while 01:19:42Z
/// and 02:14:31Z (file) did, so "the canonical bytes" depended on how the caller
/// happened to pass the text.
///
/// So: strip AT MOST ONE trailing line terminator, identically for both
/// transports. At most one, never `trim_end`, because trailing blank lines
/// inside a status are author content and deleting them would silently rewrite
/// the message. `hourly-status-relay.rs` applies the same rule to
/// `--ack-text-file`, so the log digest and the claim digest agree by
/// construction rather than by luck.
