# hermit-dbi — DBI / DynamoRIO backend agent

## Purpose

Advance the **DBI (DynamoRIO) backend** so more of the corpus runs under
`hermit run --backend dbi` with a real Detcore Tool driving the guest. Ratchet
the pass count upward with evidence, and keep the DBI packaging (client `.so`,
runtime footprint, RPATH) working.

## What this agent owns

- The DBI client and `DbiGuest`/Tool adapter in `reverie`, and DBI-specific
  handling in `hermit`.
- The DBI columns of `validate.sh --backend-compat-only`.
- DBI example-tool exercises and the vendored DynamoRIO runtime wiring.

## Constraints

- **The DBI client must be release-built** — debug frames overflow DynamoRIO's
  ~56K client stack.
- **Panics abort under DBI** — a Rust panic in a handler `SIGABRT`s the process;
  `catch_unwind` is dead. Fail deterministically, do not rely on unwinding.
- The Tool is compiled into `client.so`; there is **no runtime tool selection**
  and `--backend dbi`/`sabre` is a build-time choice, not a runtime flag.
- DBI follows fork/exec children by default (`-follow_children` ON).
- **Additive Reverie API only** (see `AGENTS.md` Reverie API Policy); discuss
  core abstraction changes with the user first.
- **Bind claims to Hermit+Reverie SHAs, backend, and `L0/L1/L2`.** A DBI pin
  bump can break the backend (undefined-symbol regressions) — validate
  `run_dbi_*` CLI tests against the exact Reverie SHA before proposing a pin.
- A parity pass requires byte equality of exit status, stdout, stderr, and the
  complete INFO log. Never strip numeric values to manufacture agreement.

## Post-facto human-review criteria

Apply `post-facto-human-review` for any of the four triggers: (1) new syscall
support (leave `AUTONOMOUS-BOT-IMPLEMENTED` + `TODO-HUMAN-REVIEW(PR-id)` tags),
(2) a Reverie API/core-abstraction change (`Tool`/`Guest`/`Backend`/interception),
(3) a new determinization strategy, (4) a core DetCore scheduling change (always
labeled; canonical example is Hermit PR #1151). Routine backend parity is not a
trigger by itself. Required PR sections: `Summary`, `Determinism`, `Validation`,
plus `Relationship to gVisor` for KVM and `Human Review Required` (naming the
numbered trigger) when labeled. Full trigger definitions and the adversarial-review
gate: [post-facto-review](../post-facto-review/SKILL.md); policy in `AGENTS.md`.

## Worktree assignment

Own the canonical slot **`worktrees/dbi/{hermit,reverie,liteinst2}`**, one slot
per agent. The coordinator registers it before the first edit with
`scripts/allocate-worktree.rs --agent hermit-dbi --task <task-id> --product all
--purpose "<one-line>"`; coordinated Hermit/Reverie branches live in the same
slot when the change spans both, while unchanged children stay detached at
their parent gitlinks. Never feature-build in a primary checkout. See
`ai_docs/transient/2026-07-27-worktree-management-map.md` for the full protocol.
