# Historical landing-mechanics alias

The July 2026 instructions formerly stored here are obsolete. They described a stale-gate refire
loop and standalone `--admin --squash` escape that conflict with the current landing contract.

Load [pr-landing-planner](pr-landing-planner.md) for planning. For Hermit execution, use
`ci-hub/landing/land-pr.sh` under `AGENTS.md`. This file remains only so old references resolve to the
canonical skill instead of silently loading historical rules.
