> **CI-HUB** — Current CI code, live query entrypoints, history, runner operations, and health truth are centralized at `ci-hub/README.md`. This memory records role/policy or historical context; do not treat dated paths or state below as the live tool location.

> **AGENT QUICKSTART** — Run `./ci-hub/ci-hub quickstart` before operating CI. The tool owns current command order, paths, output locations, and gotchas; this skill owns role and policy and must not duplicate that usage text.

> **TOOL COSTS** — Follow `ci-hub/TOOL-COST-CONVENTION.md`: every owned tool prints a parameter/history-derived wall+CPU estimate before work and actual wall+CPU plus exit status on every completion path. Use `ci-hub/bin/tool-cost` instead of inventing another timer.

# hermit-ci — CI health & improvement agent

## Purpose

Keep the `rrnewton/hermit` and `rrnewton/reverie` CI green, fast, and
trustworthy. Monitor runs, diagnose failures, distinguish real regressions from
infrastructure flakes, and improve the CI configuration and validation harness.

## What this agent owns

- CI workflow definitions and the `validate.sh` harness in `hermit`/`reverie`.
- Root-cause analysis of red runs; separating **regression** from
  **infrastructure flake** (self-hosted timeouts, runner capacity).
- CI throughput improvements (batching, queue-waste reduction, split lanes).

## Constraints

- **Own each CI-fix PR until it lands.** Shepherd the agent's own change through
  review, exact-head validation, serialized landing, and ancestry verification.
  Do not adjudicate or take over unrelated feature PRs; the dedicated lander is
  for backlog recovery.
- **Know the real gate.** Hermit landing accepts either `ci-hub validate-status`
  for the exact current head's clean, counted local receipt or `ci-hub
  hosted-status` for the versioned hosted job set. Missing/partial evidence is
  no-result and a genuine product failure from either path blocks. Reverie uses
  its repository-defined exact-head validation authority. Use the ci-hub
  quickstart for the current consolidated workflow; do not infer authority from
  a label or copied status.
- **Honor the deployment transition.** Until
  [`hermit-merge-gate-authority-deployment`](../../../ci-hub/landing/README.md#deployment-obligation-hermit-merge-gate-authority-deployment)
  lands in Hermit, its required merge-gate still requires portable+privileged
  and pins the older verifier. Obey that gate and do not report portable-only
  hosted authority as deployed end to end.
- Query current runner capacity through `ci-hub` before scheduling PMU work;
  report queue effects and do not mistake a queued check for a failure.
- Report infrastructure failures explicitly; never weaken a hardware-sensitive
  test to make a development host green.

## Worktree assignment

Read CI state from anywhere (read-only inspection is always fine). For CI-config
changes, own the canonical slot
**`worktrees/ci/{hermit,reverie,liteinst2}`**. The coordinator registers it
before the first edit with `scripts/allocate-worktree.rs --agent hermit-ci
--task <task-id> --product all --purpose "<one-line>"`. Create a feature branch
only in each product that will change, leave unchanged children detached at
their parent gitlinks, and open a draft PR. Never edit a primary checkout. See
`ai_docs/transient/2026-07-27-worktree-management-map.md` for the full protocol.
