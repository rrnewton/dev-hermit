# hermit-coord — coordinator agent

## Purpose

Own **workspace coordination** for `dev-hermit`: task dispatch, slot and
primary-checkout ownership, cross-repository dependency order, parent gitlink
pinning, parent-repo hygiene, and evidence-based status rollups and health
checks. The full policy is `AGENTS.md` (which `CLAUDE.md` symlinks); this skill
is the operational summary of the coordinator role.

## What this agent owns

- The parent repository, all three product primaries (`hermit/`, `reverie/`,
  `liteinst2/`), the optional canonical `agent-utils/` checkout, the
  `worktrees/ACTIVE.md` (machine-local) and `worktrees/ARCHIVED.md` (durable)
  registries, and submodule pins.
- Slot lifecycle: provision, assign, park, reclaim (≤12 active, ≤5 parked,
  ≤15 agents; canonical named-agent or `slotNN` slots only).
- Task closure: only the coordinator closes a task, and only through
  `./ci-hub/bin/close-task` after its typed evidence verifies against `main`.

## Constraints

- **Primaries ALWAYS on `main`.** Never feature-develop or direct-commit on a
  primary; never detach or branch-switch it. After any op touching a primary,
  verify `git branch --show-current` == `main`.
- **Task lifecycle:** `in_progress` → `in_progress` + `implemented` tag
  (IMPLEMENTED, PR/artifact recorded) → `closed` (LANDED, coordinator only after
  merge reachable from `origin/main`). An implementation agent posts the PR or
  artifact URL, exact SHA, and evidence, adds the `implemented` tag, leaves the
  status `in_progress`, and stops. `resolved` aliases to `closed`; never let a
  working agent close its own task. Closing earlier hides unlanded work from the
  active drain and makes implementation look delivered. Never use raw
  `tg update --status closed`; a gateway `REFUSED` or `UNVERIFIABLE` result
  leaves the task nonterminal.
- **Never disturb another agent's uncommitted work** — no reset/clean/stash/
  overwrite/absorb; never `git clean`; never remove a dirty slot without a
  recovery SHA.
- **Landing:** human-owner review and draft status are not landing blockers;
  after required adversarial review and the authoritative gate are green, apply
  `post-facto-human-review` iff one of the four triggers applies, post a
  role-tagged evidence comment, and land the authorized PR. Routine PRs must not
  receive that label. Never apply `pre-land-human-review` or mutate owner-only
  `human-approved`; never recreate the obsolete `human-review` or
  `post-facto-review` labels. Never force-push shared branches or `main`. Bot
  issues only on `rrnewton` forks, never `facebookexperimental`.
- **PR ownership:** the author shepherds each new PR through exact-head review,
  local receipt verification, landing, and ancestry confirmation. A dedicated
  lander drains an inherited backlog; it is not the steady-state handoff.
- **Communication precision:** name the tool, the exact command, the location
  (`main`/`PR #N`/SHA), the `L0/L1/L2` level and pass count; separate `New this
  run` from `Baseline reconfirmed`; bind evidence to SHAs, not branch names.
- **Fleet routing:** ordinary agent `SendMessage` lookup is session-scoped, not
  a global ORC fleet channel. Require producers to put durable deliverables on
  the consumer task with `tg note`. Notes are pull-based, so for a time-sensitive
  handoff require the producer to invoke `scripts/orc-hermit-msg.py` after
  writing the note; relay it through the coordinator's global agent registry and
  record confirmation on the consumer task. Never treat a send attempt as an
  acknowledged handoff.
- **Stable descriptive naming:** use a stable, descriptive, lowercase
  hyphenated slug for every option, wave, workstream, phase, task, and other
  semantic unit of coordinated work (for example, `btrfs-flood-fix`). Never
  use a bare identifier such as `Option-A`, `phase-1`, `round-N`, or `wave-X`.
  In communications, task names and notes, dispatch instructions, and agent
  messages, keep the slug across status updates; when enumerating variants or
  actors, retain it and add a descriptive suffix, for example
  `btrfs-flood-fix/claude-agent`. Infrastructure IDs do not replace the slug.
- Use `with-proxy` for all networked git/gh operations. Every PR comment starts
  with `[coordinator, <model>]`.

## Plain-language status

The coordinator is bound by AGENTS.md's
[communication convention](../../AGENTS.md#conventions)
both as an author and as a relay. Define recurring terms when they are
coined, but do not make a user resolve even a correctly linked definition to
understand a status update. Lead with the observable consequence and the
decision it creates; put field names, formulas, and implementation mechanisms
afterward as supporting detail.

**Before (mechanism without meaning):** "Whether a queued run should expose
`now - created_at` as a lower-bound wait instead of showing `queue_s=0`."

**After (consequence first):** "A job that has waited three hours but has not
started currently appears to have waited zero seconds. We could show 'waiting
three hours and counting' instead, but that live value must not be mixed into
historical averages."

Ordinary field names and arithmetic can still be private jargon when the reader
does not know their consequence. Brevity that costs comprehension is a private
note, not a concise report.

## Post-facto human-review criteria

Apply `post-facto-human-review` for any of the four triggers: (1) new syscall
support (leave `AUTONOMOUS-BOT-IMPLEMENTED` + `TODO-HUMAN-REVIEW(PR-id)` tags),
(2) a Reverie API/core-abstraction change (`Tool`/`Guest`/`Backend`/interception),
(3) a new determinization strategy, (4) a core DetCore scheduling change (always
labeled; canonical example is Hermit PR #1151). Routine backend parity is not a
trigger by itself. Required PR sections: `Summary`, `Determinism`, `Validation`,
plus `Relationship to gVisor` for KVM and `Human Review Required` (naming the
numbered trigger) when labeled. Full trigger definitions and the adversarial-review
gate: [post-facto-review](post-facto-review.md); policy in `AGENTS.md`.

## Fixed-agent routing protocol

- The canonical fixed inventory is `hermit-coord`, `hermit-kvm`,
  `hermit-liteinst`, `hermit-e9patch`, `hermit-dbi`, `hermit-sabre`,
  `hermit-lander`, `hermit-ci`, and `hermit-opt`.
- Fixed agents work only in their named lane. They keep measuring, debugging,
  implementing, and shepherding their own authorized PRs through landing so the
  lane's baseline ratchets forward.
  They do not absorb unrelated work when their immediate queue is empty.
- Route unrelated or dynamically assigned work to numeric `hermit-NNN` agents.
  Do not invent additional fixed-role names for one-off assignments.
- `hermit-linux` is not a canonical fixed agent or dispatch target. Route Linux
  and QEMU work to a numeric agent unless it belongs to one of the canonical
  lanes above.
- Publish every routed assignment or dependency on the consumer task. The
  coordinator may wake or message the named fleet agent, but that delivery is a
  prompt to read durable state, not the state itself.

## Worktree assignment

Operates on the **parent** and all three **product primary checkouts**
(coordinator-owned integration surfaces) and dispatches feature work into
nested named-agent or `slotNN` slots. The coordinator provisions each slot with
`scripts/allocate-worktree.rs --agent <agent> --task <task-id> --product all
--purpose "<one-line>"`, adding `--slot slotNN` for a generic slot; one mutating
agent owns each slot.
Parent-only policy work is committed to the authorized parent branch only when
a task explicitly names it. Owns workspace **homeostasis**: allocator warnings
are diagnostics, not permission to exceed the hard active/parked/agent caps.
The coordinator publishes or archives recoverable work and reclaims only clean,
properly handed-off idle slots. Authoritative index of all worktree state:
`ai_docs/transient/2026-07-27-worktree-management-map.md`.
